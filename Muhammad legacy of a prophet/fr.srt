1
00:00:00,706 --> 00:00:02,503
Il y a mille-quatre-cent ans

2
00:00:02,555 --> 00:00:05,172
un simple marchand
qui ne savait ni lire ni écrire

3
00:00:05,197 --> 00:00:07,207
a amené un profond changement en Arabie.

4
00:00:08,076 --> 00:00:10,245
Son nom était Muhammad.

5
00:00:12,359 --> 00:00:16,016
Aujourd'hui, son influence
s'étend dans le monde entier

6
00:00:16,116 --> 00:00:17,784
les États-Unis inclus...

7
00:00:20,988 --> 00:00:22,322
Voici son histoire.

8
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:27,494
Et l'histoire de millions d'Américains qui suivent
ses enseignements de prophète ultime de Dieu.

9
00:00:30,497 --> 00:00:35,435
La majorité du financement de Muhammad
Legacy of a Prophet vient de

10
00:00:36,069 --> 00:00:38,438
CORPORATION FOR PUBLIC BROADCASTING

11
00:00:39,106 --> 00:00:42,876
et de THE DAVID AND
LUCILE PACKARD FOUNDATION

12
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:44,778
ARABIAN BULK TRADE

13
00:00:45,312 --> 00:00:49,516
SABADIA FAMILY FOUNDATION,
THE EL-HIBRI FOUNDATION

14
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:52,119
la FONDATION IRFAN KATHWARI

15
00:00:52,686 --> 00:00:54,054
et MIR IMRAN.

16
00:00:56,490 --> 00:01:01,295
Des fonds supplémentaires ont aussi
été apportés par de nombreux individus et entités.

17
00:01:50,277 --> 00:01:52,045
Il n'était ni grand et fin

18
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,515
ni petit et gros.

19
00:01:55,682 --> 00:01:58,519
Quand il regardait quelqu'un
il le regardait dans les yeux.

20
00:01:59,987 --> 00:02:02,422
C'était le plus généreux des Hommes

21
00:02:03,457 --> 00:02:05,392
le plus vrai dans ses paroles

22
00:02:06,493 --> 00:02:08,462
le plus patient de tous

23
00:02:09,496 --> 00:02:11,698
et ses ascendants étaient des plus nobles.

24
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:15,569
Toute personne qui l'aurait croisé dirait

25
00:02:16,403 --> 00:02:18,605
jamais avant ou après l'avoir vu

26
00:02:19,306 --> 00:02:20,836
n'ais-je vu pareille personne

27
00:02:21,341 --> 00:02:24,344
Muhammad, décrit par un de ses contemporains.

28
00:02:25,312 --> 00:02:27,414
Muhammad est un Homme qui a été confronté

29
00:02:27,915 --> 00:02:30,751
à une situation qui semblait inextricable.

30
00:02:31,785 --> 00:02:35,956
Il vivait dans un continent où
les gens s'entretuaient littéralement

31
00:02:36,056 --> 00:02:41,395
dans une vendetta infinie, entraînant
un déferlement de guerres et de violence.

32
00:02:42,062 --> 00:02:45,632
Sentant que la société allait
s'effondrer et qu'il n'y avait pas d'espoir.

33
00:02:45,866 --> 00:02:47,968
Il leur a donné de l'espoir à lui seul

34
00:02:48,268 --> 00:02:50,337
En l'espace de 23 ans

35
00:02:50,671 --> 00:02:56,143
il a amené la paix et redonné de l'espoir
à l'Arabie et un nouveau modèle pour le monde.

36
00:02:59,279 --> 00:03:03,120
L'islam, la religion de Muhammad,
formée d'abord en Arabie

37
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:07,221
compte aujourd'hui 1.2 milliard
d'adeptes de par le monde.

38
00:03:12,359 --> 00:03:15,462
Aux États-Unis il y a
environ 7 millions de musulmans

39
00:03:16,163 --> 00:03:18,765
et c'est ici la religion avec
la croissance la plus rapide

40
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:20,234
et la plus diverse.

41
00:03:23,537 --> 00:03:28,408
Comme c'est le cas pour l'Amérique elle même,
les musulmans ici viennent des quatre coins du monde.

42
00:03:29,243 --> 00:03:31,845
Ils ont un lien en commun

43
00:03:32,312 --> 00:03:35,983
pas seulement dans leur foi
et dans leurs mosquées

44
00:03:36,416 --> 00:03:39,720
mais dans cette histoire de Muhammad,
qui leur sert d'exemple.

45
00:03:40,787 --> 00:03:44,525
Elle leur apprend comment se comporter

46
00:03:45,292 --> 00:03:47,528
comment être un citoyen constructif

47
00:03:47,895 --> 00:03:51,431
comment être un bon parent,
et comment être un bon enfant

48
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:54,168
comment chercher le savoir et la vérité.

49
00:03:55,135 --> 00:04:00,007
Ce sont des valeurs qui se retrouvent
le plus, pour les musulmans,

50
00:04:00,007 --> 00:04:02,609
dans la vie de Muhammad.

51
00:04:05,412 --> 00:04:10,784
Dans le Coran, Allah dit que Muhammad est
le meilleur exemple à suivre.

52
00:04:11,652 --> 00:04:15,422
Et qu'il est le modèle pour gérer
nos relations interpersonelles

53
00:04:16,657 --> 00:04:19,226
et quand on est dans une
position d'authorité

54
00:04:19,726 --> 00:04:23,063
comment essayer d'implémenter
la justice et la loi

55
00:04:27,534 --> 00:04:30,437
Le prophète Muammad, il demandait
à ses contemporains

56
00:04:31,205 --> 00:04:32,306
aimez vous votre créateur?

57
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,708
Aimez vos semblables d'abord en les servant.

58
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:36,844
Qu'est-ce que ça veut dire?

59
00:04:37,244 --> 00:04:38,813
Ça veut dire que tout ce blabla,

60
00:04:38,813 --> 00:04:40,013
I love God et companie.

61
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:43,951
Si tu veux vraiment [remplir ta mission], tu sais
oublie le blabla, agis et sors.

62
00:04:43,984 --> 00:04:46,019
Tu veux servir Dieu, sers les gens.

63
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,824
Quelle meilleure manière de servir les gens
que de risquer notre vie pour les sauver.

64
00:04:58,065 --> 00:05:01,668
Le 11 septembre a changé
la face du monde

65
00:05:02,436 --> 00:05:06,573
et il a aussi mis les musulmans
dans le viseur

66
00:05:09,009 --> 00:05:11,578
les musulmans font face à beaucoup
d'hostilité

67
00:05:12,546 --> 00:05:14,548
Mais c'est aussi une époque
de changement.

68
00:05:15,115 --> 00:05:18,051
Beaucoup de gens veulent
comprendre ce qu'est l'islam

69
00:05:18,485 --> 00:05:22,089
et comprendre qui était le prophète
et ce que contient le Coran

70
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:24,091
Qui sont les musulmans et
quelles sont leurs coutumes

71
00:05:27,528 --> 00:05:29,329
Par l'histoire
du prophète Muhammad

72
00:05:29,763 --> 00:05:32,165
nous avons pu faire des rapprochements

73
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:35,435
et soudainement on peut s'identifier

74
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:38,772
à des événements d'il y a 1500 ans

75
00:05:39,773 --> 00:05:42,209
et voir que leurs problèmes
ne sont pas obsolètes

76
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:44,111
ils sont universels.

77
00:05:45,112 --> 00:05:46,446
C'est ce qu'il m'a appris.

78
00:05:49,391 --> 00:05:52,861
Voici l'histoire que les musulmans
ont préservé et transmis

79
00:05:52,886 --> 00:05:56,857
de génération en génération
depuis 1400 ans.

80
00:05:59,159 --> 00:06:02,829
L'histoire d'un marchand,
d'un mari, d'un père,

81
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:08,068
d'un homme d'état et d'un guerrier
qu'ils considèrent comme le dernier prophète.

82
00:06:09,803 --> 00:06:14,208
L'Homme dont les enseignements
continuent d'influencer leurs vies aujourd'hui.

83
00:06:22,238 --> 00:06:25,980
Muhammad: l'héritage d'un prophète

84
00:06:26,987 --> 00:06:28,655
La vie de Muhammad

85
00:06:30,023 --> 00:06:31,625
est, dans ses détails probablement

86
00:06:31,992 --> 00:06:36,463
plus connue que celle de n'importe quelle autre
figure religieuse antérieure aux temps modernes.

87
00:06:37,364 --> 00:06:39,833
Ses compagnons ont fait attention

88
00:06:40,067 --> 00:06:44,671
à collecter toutes les mémoires
des paroles qu'il a prononcé

89
00:06:44,905 --> 00:06:46,340
et des actes qu'il a effectués.

90
00:06:47,107 --> 00:06:51,144
Une partie de ces traditions
ont pu être ajoutées à posteriori

91
00:06:51,745 --> 00:06:56,049
mais l'essence de l'enseignement me semble très
vraisemblable et il est difficile de réfuter

92
00:06:56,917 --> 00:07:00,427
le fait qu'elles décrivent la
vie d'un homme bien réel.

93
00:07:03,357 --> 00:07:04,825
Selon les sources Islamiques

94
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:08,462
Muhammad bin Abdullah, ou fils d'Abdullah

95
00:07:08,962 --> 00:07:12,499
est né en l'an 570
dans la ville de la Mecque

96
00:07:13,033 --> 00:07:15,202
en Arabie Saoudite actuelle.

97
00:07:18,472 --> 00:07:20,908
Un poète de l'époque
a dit de La Mecque

98
00:07:21,108 --> 00:07:25,546
qu'elle était aussi insupportable en été qu'en hiver.

99
00:07:27,714 --> 00:07:31,718
Le monde qui vu l'avènement
de Muhammad était cruel

100
00:07:32,119 --> 00:07:35,689
Il y régnaient la faim, la
violence et les guerres tribales.

101
00:07:38,492 --> 00:07:41,161
On n'était rien sans sa tribu

102
00:07:41,895 --> 00:07:46,500
Dans ce monde perilleux, un individu
seul n'avait aucune chance de survie.

103
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:51,572
Par conséquent, la tribu était la chose
la plus importante et sacrée en Arabie.

104
00:07:51,905 --> 00:07:56,777
C'est une société basée
entièrement sur la méfiance

105
00:07:57,177 --> 00:07:59,313
Et si quelqu'un attaque mon clan

106
00:07:59,646 --> 00:08:02,716
il devient de mon bon droit d'attaquer
quiconque fait partie de son clan.

107
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:06,687
La justice était confondue
avec la vengeance.

108
00:08:07,821 --> 00:08:11,791
Les Arabes du sixième siècle n'avaient aucunes lois,

109
00:08:12,326 --> 00:08:15,963
aucune religion et aucun
gouvernement en commun.

110
00:08:17,865 --> 00:08:19,666
Dans ce monde perilleux,

111
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:25,305
Muhammad eut la chance de naître dans la
tribu influente des Quraych de La Mecque.

112
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:31,945
Mais, son père mourut avant sa naissance, et
sa mère mourut alors qu'il n'avait que 6 ans.

113
00:08:32,946 --> 00:08:36,683
Son oncle, Abu Talib, fut
chargé d'élever le jeune orphelin.

114
00:08:37,951 --> 00:08:42,723
Il est évident qu'il a du beaucoup se
tourmenter de son avenir, que deviendrait-il?

115
00:08:43,423 --> 00:08:48,061
Et par conséquent il devait
être un enfant très introverti.

116
00:08:49,363 --> 00:08:53,867
Muhammad avait cette habitude
de partir dans le désert pour

117
00:08:53,901 --> 00:08:57,070
contempler les étoiles et réfléchir
à la raison de son orphelinage

118
00:08:57,070 --> 00:08:59,573
Et qu'est-ce que lui
réservait l'avenir ?

119
00:09:01,775 --> 00:09:04,578
Les orphelins étaient marginalisés

120
00:09:04,578 --> 00:09:07,814
par conséquent tout le
reste de sa vie, il s'est identifié

121
00:09:08,248 --> 00:09:11,585
aux pauvres et déshérités.

122
00:09:13,053 --> 00:09:17,858
La Mecque du temps de la jeunesse de Muhammad
était un centre religieux et commercial.

123
00:09:18,225 --> 00:09:21,528
située au croisement de deux voies majeures

124
00:09:23,997 --> 00:09:26,834
Les pèlerins venaient de toute
l'Arabie pour vouer un culte

125
00:09:26,934 --> 00:09:29,970
aux centaines d'idoles
qui entouraient la Kaaba

126
00:09:30,237 --> 00:09:32,573
un sanctuaire ancien
situé au coeur de la Ville

127
00:09:34,575 --> 00:09:39,279
Les alentours de la Kaaba étaient
sacrés et il était interdit de s'y battre

128
00:09:41,215 --> 00:09:44,518
La manne financière
des pèlerinages a permis

129
00:09:44,518 --> 00:09:49,089
à un jeune Homme comme Muhammad de
gagner sa vie dans les marchés de la Mecque

130
00:09:50,791 --> 00:09:55,229
Bientôt Muhammad devenait un
commis pour des marchands argentés

131
00:09:55,629 --> 00:09:58,632
enmenant leurs biens sur
des caravanes à travers l'Arabie

132
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,938
Ces voyages lui permirent de rencontrer
de nombreuses autres tribus et communautés

133
00:10:05,239 --> 00:10:07,174
et de s'exposer à
des idées nouvelles.

134
00:10:08,775 --> 00:10:13,146
Il a probablement appris ainsi
les différences entre les tribus.

135
00:10:13,847 --> 00:10:18,585
Rencontré des gens parlant d'autres
langues, croisé des Chrétiens et des Juifs.

136
00:10:19,186 --> 00:10:22,122
Et appris de leur bouche
quelle étaient leurs croyances,

137
00:10:22,155 --> 00:10:25,225
leur religion, leur culture.

138
00:10:26,768 --> 00:10:29,905
Avec ces rencontres, Muhammad
aurait réalisé que pour les Juifs

139
00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:33,433
et les Chrétiens, les saintes
écritures sont cruciales.

140
00:10:34,535 --> 00:10:38,038
Les deux avaient des
textes envoyés par Dieu,

141
00:10:38,305 --> 00:10:41,275
un message sacré délivré aux prophètes

142
00:10:41,942 --> 00:10:46,246
et c'était ainsi que les gens
pouvaient se connecter au Divin.

143
00:10:49,049 --> 00:10:52,786
Alors que Muhammad avait 25 ans,

144
00:10:53,253 --> 00:10:55,455
il y eut un changement énorme dans sa vie.

145
00:10:55,822 --> 00:10:57,925
Une veuve argentée

146
00:10:58,292 --> 00:10:59,993
plus vieille que lui, appelée Khadija

147
00:11:01,028 --> 00:11:05,065
lui demandait de conduire
ses caravanes en Syrie.

148
00:11:06,533 --> 00:11:11,238
Muhammad enmena tout ses biens
et partit avec la caravanne en Syrie,

149
00:11:11,705 --> 00:11:13,073
il fit un travail incroyable.

150
00:11:14,208 --> 00:11:18,745
Et son respect pour lui se
transforma en une admiration.

151
00:11:18,779 --> 00:11:21,281
Et elle se renseigna sur lui
par le biais d'une de ses amies.

152
00:11:23,884 --> 00:11:27,554
Peu après Khadija demanda
à Muhammad de l'épouser

153
00:11:29,857 --> 00:11:32,526
Je t'apprécies du fait
de notre relation, elle dit

154
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:35,329
et du fait de ta
réputation parmis les tiens

155
00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:40,701
ta fiabilité, ta bonté et ton honnêteté

156
00:11:42,069 --> 00:11:43,770
Et ceci est intéressant,

157
00:11:43,804 --> 00:11:45,205
elle est très belle,

158
00:11:45,205 --> 00:11:46,406
mais elle atteint les 40 ans

159
00:11:46,406 --> 00:11:48,475
elle arrive à sa maturité et son échéance

160
00:11:48,876 --> 00:11:50,777
alors qu'il est un jeune homme de 25 ans

161
00:11:51,144 --> 00:11:52,412
il est orphelin

162
00:11:52,746 --> 00:11:57,518
Et il accepte cette proposition,
qui est arrangée dans la famille

163
00:11:57,551 --> 00:11:58,919
ce qui aboutit en effet à un mariage

164
00:11:59,219 --> 00:12:01,822
Et souvent les gens
ont dit, pour le dénigrer,

165
00:12:01,822 --> 00:12:04,525
que ce mariage avait eu lieu que
parcequ'il l'arrangeait matériellement.

166
00:12:04,525 --> 00:12:08,929
Il avait juste épousé la vieille
veuve pour profiter de son argent

167
00:12:09,396 --> 00:12:13,834
Mais selon moi, il n'y a aucun doute
qu'il avait vraiment aimé Khadidja

168
00:12:15,302 --> 00:12:19,773
Le mariage de Khadidja et
Muhammad découlera en 4 filles

169
00:12:20,274 --> 00:12:22,376
et deux fils morts
dans leur enfance.

170
00:12:24,111 --> 00:12:27,714
C'était un père de famille et un
marchand prospère et respecté

171
00:12:29,616 --> 00:12:32,586
Mais alors qu'il approchait
ses 40 ans, Muhammad

172
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:35,789
etait de plus en
plus troublé par

173
00:12:35,789 --> 00:12:38,659
les problèmes de
la société Meccane.

174
00:12:39,493 --> 00:12:40,894
En quelques générations,

175
00:12:40,894 --> 00:12:46,166
ils étaient passés de cette existance
brutale dans les steppes d'Arabie

176
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:49,536
à devenir des banquiers, financiers,

177
00:12:49,736 --> 00:12:52,840
hommes d'affaire, marchands,
avec beaucoup d'argent.

178
00:12:53,507 --> 00:12:57,678
Evidemment, c'était merveilleux, tout
le monde était ravi de cette prosperité

179
00:12:57,845 --> 00:13:01,181
Mais cette époque avait aussi ses travers,

180
00:13:01,515 --> 00:13:04,751
car l'économie de marché, causait

181
00:13:04,918 --> 00:13:09,056
comme nous le voyons trop à
l'Ouest, une grande compétitivité

182
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:14,061
Les gens n'avaient plus cet impératif de
s'occuper des pauvres et des gens dans le besoin

183
00:13:14,127 --> 00:13:16,597
et des membres affaiblis
de la tribu Quraych

184
00:13:16,763 --> 00:13:19,688
Ils pensaient devoir se concentrer
sur la maximisation de leurs revenus

185
00:13:20,634 --> 00:13:22,035
Leur société était superbe

186
00:13:22,035 --> 00:13:24,339
Leur ville était en pleine croissance

187
00:13:24,371 --> 00:13:25,639
les affaires étaient bonnes

188
00:13:25,806 --> 00:13:28,208
Ils vivaient dans une société prospère

189
00:13:28,742 --> 00:13:31,044
Et lorsque les temps sont prospères

190
00:13:31,378 --> 00:13:33,413
il est facile de devenir hédoniste

191
00:13:33,514 --> 00:13:35,883
De se pencher sur la question de
que sont les plaisirs de la vie (peterson)

192
00:13:37,993 --> 00:13:43,031
Muhammad prenait souvent refuge dans les
montagnes alentours à la Mecque pour y méditer

193
00:13:45,425 --> 00:13:50,864
C'est lors d'un tel voyage, en l'an 610,
que Muhammad vécut une expérience

194
00:13:51,131 --> 00:13:53,066
qui allait changer l'histoire.

195
00:13:54,401 --> 00:13:57,204
Le prophète partait, de temps en temps,

196
00:13:58,672 --> 00:14:01,742
vers un pic appelé Jabal al-Nur,
la montagne de lumière.

197
00:14:07,489 --> 00:14:10,225
Quand on escalade cette montagne,
beaucoup le font encore aujourd'hui

198
00:14:11,251 --> 00:14:15,589
il y a une grotte au sommet
appelée al-Hira en Arabe

199
00:14:16,723 --> 00:14:20,327
dans cette grotte il s'isolait
souvent pour réfléchir

200
00:14:21,828 --> 00:14:22,663
et pour prier

201
00:14:23,130 --> 00:14:24,298
Pour se retrouver seul avec Dieu.

202
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:30,437
La révélation fut un événement instantané

203
00:14:33,473 --> 00:14:35,876
La descente du ciel fut fracassante

204
00:14:38,645 --> 00:14:43,851
Muhammad fut réveillé d'un assoupissement
et se senti entièrement enveloppé

205
00:14:43,851 --> 00:14:46,253
par une présence Divine terrifiante.

206
00:14:49,556 --> 00:14:52,826
Il a rapporté qu'un
ange semblait l'écraser

207
00:14:52,826 --> 00:14:55,395
dans une étreinte terrifiante

208
00:14:55,696 --> 00:15:00,000
il lui semblait que tout son souffle
de vie s'échappait de son corps

209
00:15:01,243 --> 00:15:03,545
Et une voix lui a dit "Récite!"

210
00:15:06,306 --> 00:15:09,042
Muhammad dit: "non, je
ne suis pas un perroquet. "

211
00:15:09,067 --> 00:15:10,969
La voix reitéra

212
00:15:13,647 --> 00:15:14,615
Recite

213
00:15:17,851 --> 00:15:22,356
Et l'étreinte se renforca pendant
que lui, à la limite de ses capacités

214
00:15:24,458 --> 00:15:28,495
Muhammad ressentit en lui
les premiers mots

215
00:15:28,495 --> 00:15:32,733
d'un nouvel évangile, en
Arabe, qui sortaient de ses levres.

216
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:42,042
Celà veut dire "Récite au
nom de ton Dieu qui t'a créé"

217
00:15:44,244 --> 00:15:46,780
L'Islam était né

218
00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:52,920
Et le prophète, ayant
reçu la parole divine,

219
00:15:53,921 --> 00:15:57,124
commença à trembler dans une peur suprême

220
00:15:58,025 --> 00:16:01,828
parceque la réalité divine est
sans pareille à l'expérience humaine

221
00:16:02,062 --> 00:16:03,163
Lorsqu'il sortit de la grotte

222
00:16:06,567 --> 00:16:09,303
Lorsqu'il parvint à s'échapper
de la grotte, il se retourna

223
00:16:11,638 --> 00:16:13,907
et vu l'Archange s'étendre
sur le ciel tout entier

224
00:16:15,414 --> 00:16:18,178
Peu importe où il
regardait, Gabriel était là.

225
00:16:19,245 --> 00:16:25,052
Ce n'est pas une simple image angélique,
c'est une présence, une entité, un pouvoir.

226
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:29,256
Voilà comment l'inexprimable

227
00:16:29,523 --> 00:16:33,927
incompréhensible, intrinsèquement
transcendant et indescriptible Dieu

228
00:16:34,761 --> 00:16:36,430
se présente à nous.

229
00:16:40,601 --> 00:16:44,371
Voilà un événement qui
changea tout dans sa vie

230
00:16:44,638 --> 00:16:47,040
Et en redescendant de la
montagne, il tremble encore.

231
00:16:47,875 --> 00:16:49,543
Pour moi c'est un état de choc

232
00:16:50,811 --> 00:16:52,412
Voici quelqu'un qui est parti

233
00:16:52,713 --> 00:16:54,481
à la recherche de la transcendance

234
00:16:54,681 --> 00:16:56,984
et la transcendance lui a

235
00:16:58,385 --> 00:16:59,019
répondu.

236
00:17:02,422 --> 00:17:07,961
Muhammad a été si perturbé par cette expérience
qu'il a commencé par penser être possédé

237
00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:11,899
Il est rentré chez lui
directement pour voir Khadija.

238
00:17:13,166 --> 00:17:17,671
Il s'est jeté à son cou et lui
a demandé, "protège moi"

239
00:17:18,005 --> 00:17:21,475
"couvre moi, tiens moi compagnie
jusqu'à ce que l'horreur soit passée"

240
00:17:24,178 --> 00:17:27,181
Khadija a été là
pour le rassurer

241
00:17:29,349 --> 00:17:32,152
"Il a demandé, "suis-je devenu un kahin,
un voyant fou?"

242
00:17:32,386 --> 00:17:33,520
Elle a répondu

243
00:17:33,754 --> 00:17:36,590
Non mon cheri, ce n'est pas
dans les manières de Dieu

244
00:17:37,057 --> 00:17:39,159
Tu as vu une révélation divine.

245
00:17:42,663 --> 00:17:46,533
Le message reçu par Muhammad
sur la montagne de lumière était simple:

246
00:17:47,267 --> 00:17:50,137
Il avait pour mission de diffuser les
paroles du seul et unique vrai Dieu

247
00:17:51,872 --> 00:17:55,709
Mais Muhammad doutait encore
de la véracité de son expérience.

248
00:17:56,944 --> 00:18:01,215
Khadija pensa qu'il serait bon de consulter

249
00:18:01,582 --> 00:18:04,551
son cousin Waraqa
qui était Chrétien.

250
00:18:04,985 --> 00:18:08,222
Elle lui dit, nous devons aller voir
quelqu'un qui est compétent sur ces sujets

251
00:18:08,922 --> 00:18:11,959
Parceque, si on te dit que tu
vas reçevoir un message Divin

252
00:18:12,192 --> 00:18:14,061
eh bien il y a eu des
messages antérieurs

253
00:18:14,228 --> 00:18:17,764
Donc allons voir Waraqa qui
connaît les saintes écritures

254
00:18:17,965 --> 00:18:20,400
Il connaît la Torah
et les Evangiles.

255
00:18:21,902 --> 00:18:26,440
Dès que Waraqa fut mis
au courant, il s'exclama

256
00:18:26,573 --> 00:18:28,141
Muhammad est le Prophète

257
00:18:28,575 --> 00:18:33,247
qui amènera la révélation
du Dieu unique aux Arabes

258
00:18:33,714 --> 00:18:36,016
et il prévint Muhammad

259
00:18:36,783 --> 00:18:39,253
que sa mission
ne serait pas aisée

260
00:18:40,354 --> 00:18:44,057
Il lui dit, ta tribu va te rejeter,
et ils te chasseront de ta ville

261
00:18:44,892 --> 00:18:49,763
Ces révélations ne sont jamais parvenues à
un Homme qui n'a ensuite pas été persécuté

262
00:18:50,097 --> 00:18:55,302
Car celà revient simplement à un
changement de paradigme brutal

263
00:18:58,071 --> 00:19:01,208
Au bout d'un moment, Muhammad comprit

264
00:19:01,375 --> 00:19:05,879
que les messages qu'il recevait coincidaient
bien avec des idées qu'il connaissait

265
00:19:06,547 --> 00:19:09,216
des traiditions Juives et Chrétiennes.

266
00:19:09,216 --> 00:19:11,485
Par exemple le fait de
l'existence des prophètes

267
00:19:12,853 --> 00:19:16,723
Qu'il y a des gens capables de
recevoir des messages du Divin

268
00:19:17,357 --> 00:19:21,094
et il commença à comprendre
qu'il en faisait partie

269
00:19:23,330 --> 00:19:24,852
Quand nous pensons aux
prophécies en amérique

270
00:19:25,132 --> 00:19:29,503
nous pensons au Moïse
joué par Charlton Heston

271
00:19:29,503 --> 00:19:32,472
la barbe dans le vent, le baton de berger

272
00:19:33,173 --> 00:19:36,243
Et le prophète porte des vêtements en
haillons, en s'exclamant devant la foule

273
00:19:36,243 --> 00:19:37,578
Il s'exclame comme un possédé.

274
00:19:39,246 --> 00:19:42,015
Dans le monde Islamique
le prophète n'a rien de celà

275
00:19:42,015 --> 00:19:46,286
Ici c'est une personne prise
contre son gré parmi les siens

276
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:48,188
Il est choisi par
Dieu et ne peut pas

277
00:19:48,689 --> 00:19:50,891
s'échapper de la machine
divine, d'une certaine manière

278
00:19:55,062 --> 00:19:59,566
Il faut penser comme une
société bédouine tribale pense

279
00:20:00,734 --> 00:20:05,539
Quelle est la pire chose
qui puisse vous arriver ?

280
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:08,976
Ce n'est pas de mourir,
c'est d'avoir la honte sur vous

281
00:20:10,143 --> 00:20:12,579
Ainsi, je suis
assez sûr de l'idée

282
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:17,584
que pour lui la peur de la
honte était quelque chose de clé

283
00:20:18,652 --> 00:20:21,088
Imaginez la double honte

284
00:20:21,288 --> 00:20:25,158
il va perdre la face et
être humilié devant sa tribu

285
00:20:25,359 --> 00:20:28,362
et il va être humilié devant
Allah qui lui a confié ce message

286
00:20:31,732 --> 00:20:35,836
Une des particularités qui m'a
attiré en tant que non musulman

287
00:20:35,836 --> 00:20:38,338
qui vient d'un environnement assez hétéroclite

288
00:20:38,872 --> 00:20:41,241
était son humilité. Son humanité.

289
00:20:43,277 --> 00:20:47,080
Kevin James est un pompier
superviseur de Brooklyn, New York

290
00:20:47,781 --> 00:20:50,317
qui s'est converti à
l'Islam dans sa jeunesse.

291
00:20:52,553 --> 00:20:54,922
J'ai senti une connexion personelle à lui

292
00:20:56,156 --> 00:20:59,993
Et je pense qu'il y a environ un milliard
de musulmans qui pourraient en dire de même

293
00:21:01,061 --> 00:21:03,030
cette affinité personnelle
qu'ils ressentent avec lui.

294
00:21:04,464 --> 00:21:07,734
Le fait qu'il ait grandi orphelin.
Je ne suis pas orphelin mais

295
00:21:08,535 --> 00:21:11,839
de part ma position dans la société
je me suis toujours senti ostracisé.

296
00:21:13,674 --> 00:21:16,743
Les états unis sont un pays racial

297
00:21:17,377 --> 00:21:21,315
tu es soit noir, blanc,
juif, italien, ceci ou celà

298
00:21:22,449 --> 00:21:27,287
Donc, venant d'une famille mixte, je me
suis senti comme prisonnier des limbes

299
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:34,294
My père est Natif Americain
et noir et ma mère est Juive.

300
00:21:35,329 --> 00:21:40,434
Ils étaient très a-religieux, limite
athés ou au moins agnostiques

301
00:21:42,603 --> 00:21:46,607
Je me souviens que dans ma
jeunesse on avait une dreidel

302
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:49,843
pour Hanukkah, on avait un
chandelier dans la maison et aussi

303
00:21:49,843 --> 00:21:52,513
un sapin de noel,
on avait des cadeaux.

304
00:21:54,448 --> 00:21:59,453
Donc, je n'ai jamais pu trop
m'identifier à une religion en particulier

305
00:22:00,454 --> 00:22:05,025
ce qui était encouragé c'était
la discussion, le dialogue, et

306
00:22:06,193 --> 00:22:07,261
la recherche de la vérité.

307
00:22:10,063 --> 00:22:14,034
Donc je suis passé par une periode de recherche
par l'essai et l'erreur, j'ai tâtonné.

308
00:22:14,735 --> 00:22:20,541
Et j'ai fini par tomber, je pense
qu'on peut dire tomber, sur l'Islam

309
00:22:22,709 --> 00:22:27,114
Ce qui m'a intéressé était
l'universalité du message.

310
00:22:27,848 --> 00:22:32,719
Toute religion qui donne un code
de conduite, d'éthique, de vertu et

311
00:22:33,287 --> 00:22:38,458
encourage le respect, la gratitude et
l'obeissance à un Dieu est juste pour l'Islam.

312
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:45,399
Donc, voici un livre, le noble
Coran, qui valide les autres religions

313
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:47,601
la diversité de l'humanité

314
00:22:48,368 --> 00:22:53,373
et met la responsabilité de sauver
son âme, sur le dos du croyant.

315
00:22:55,342 --> 00:22:57,945
Le Coran nous apprend que sauver une vie

316
00:22:58,278 --> 00:23:00,013
équivaut à sauver l'humanité.

317
00:23:01,148 --> 00:23:05,085
Voici une des raisons pour
lesquelles je suis devenu pompier

318
00:23:06,286 --> 00:23:09,223
Quelle meilleure vocation que de

319
00:23:09,223 --> 00:23:11,024
sauver les gens,
sauver leurs biens

320
00:23:11,458 --> 00:23:12,759
Il y a eu un autre feu au fond

321
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:14,828
Okay, voyons ça

322
00:23:16,196 --> 00:23:20,701
Après avoir été pompier je suis devenu
enquèteur sur les incendies criminels

323
00:23:22,236 --> 00:23:24,471
C'est une autre forme de
prévention pour sauver des vies

324
00:23:26,173 --> 00:23:28,008
Bon bah je pense
que la cause est claire

325
00:23:28,942 --> 00:23:32,546
Le pompier va risquer sa vie pour
te sauver, peu importe ta couleur

326
00:23:32,779 --> 00:23:35,949
noir, rouge, musulman, chrétien, athé

327
00:23:37,150 --> 00:23:40,621
Il ne te demandes pas ce que tu
penses et ne regarde pas ta couleur

328
00:23:41,121 --> 00:23:42,911
Il veut juste t'aider à
t'échapper du bâtiment

329
00:23:44,391 --> 00:23:48,462
C'est pourquoi beaucoup disent que être
pompier c'est une vocation, à cause de ce

330
00:23:49,229 --> 00:23:51,098
du don de soi

331
00:23:51,265 --> 00:23:53,534
La volonté de faire passer
les autres avant soi même

332
00:23:55,702 --> 00:23:57,538
Pour être un bon musulman,
il faut servir les autres

333
00:23:58,172 --> 00:24:00,007
En particulier, le prophète a dit,

334
00:24:00,841 --> 00:24:02,743
il a demandé aux gens autour de lui:

335
00:24:03,544 --> 00:24:05,045
Aimez vous votre créateur ?

336
00:24:06,079 --> 00:24:07,514
Rendez service à vos
semblables d'abord.

337
00:24:09,917 --> 00:24:13,654
Le message de Dieu reçu
par Muhammad établissait

338
00:24:13,654 --> 00:24:16,456
que les siens seraient tenus
responsables de leurs actions passées

339
00:24:16,924 --> 00:24:18,525
après leur mort.

340
00:24:20,427 --> 00:24:24,464
Bien que réticent à partager
cette expérience au début

341
00:24:24,831 --> 00:24:29,136
une nouvelle révélation lui
commanda d'en parler en public

342
00:24:30,604 --> 00:24:34,141
Il appelle donc les membres
de sa famille et leur dit

343
00:24:34,474 --> 00:24:38,212
que me diriez vous si je
vous disait qu'une armée

344
00:24:39,246 --> 00:24:43,250
se prépare à nous attaquer
depuis derrière la colline

345
00:24:44,151 --> 00:24:46,320
Ils ont dit qu'ils le
croiraient. Il continua

346
00:24:47,187 --> 00:24:51,024
que diriez vous si je vous disais

347
00:24:51,491 --> 00:24:52,926
que je suis le messager de Dieu.

348
00:24:54,795 --> 00:24:55,863
Ils lui répondent
que c'est ridicule

349
00:24:56,797 --> 00:24:58,432
Comment as tu oser nous réunir pour ça ?

350
00:24:58,632 --> 00:25:00,654
Il leur demande, donc aucun
de vous ne me supportera ?

351
00:25:01,001 --> 00:25:04,771
Et une seule personne,
un enfant, Ali, son cousin

352
00:25:04,913 --> 00:25:07,415
il se lève, et il dit,
moi je serai avec toi.

353
00:25:07,474 --> 00:25:09,743
Les autres trouvent
la situation ridicule

354
00:25:10,077 --> 00:25:14,481
Voici qui va suivre
ce prophète, un gamin

355
00:25:14,715 --> 00:25:18,185
Imaginez la chose, vous
avez un homme quarantenaire

356
00:25:18,185 --> 00:25:20,854
il ne sait ni lire ni
écrire et n'est pas riche

357
00:25:21,455 --> 00:25:24,658
il est orphelin, certes il
vient d'une tribu influente

358
00:25:24,658 --> 00:25:28,428
mais il travaille pour une femme.
Et il prétend être un prophète

359
00:25:29,263 --> 00:25:30,430
Dieu m'a parlé.

360
00:25:32,099 --> 00:25:33,734
Ca ne peut pas marcher.

361
00:25:37,070 --> 00:25:40,774
La révélation Divine apportée par
Muhammad à ses compatriotes de la Mecque

362
00:25:40,874 --> 00:25:42,976
était accompagné
d'un avertissement clair

363
00:25:43,076 --> 00:25:45,879
à propos de leur
société matérialiste.

364
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:52,278
Il venait avertir les gens de la
Mecque et des campagnes alentours

365
00:25:52,686 --> 00:25:54,621
et sa propre tribu des Quraich

366
00:25:54,958 --> 00:25:59,359
que si ils ne se
réunissaient pas pour édifier

367
00:25:59,359 --> 00:26:02,329
une société plus
juste et plus décente

368
00:26:03,096 --> 00:26:07,701
en restaurant les valeurs tribales
de prendre soin des pauvres

369
00:26:07,968 --> 00:26:10,971
des orphelins, des veuves, des opprimés

370
00:26:11,405 --> 00:26:13,407
il y aurait une grande catastrophe.

371
00:26:15,509 --> 00:26:17,110
Les Arabes ne croyaient
pas à la vie après la mort

372
00:26:17,110 --> 00:26:21,481
Pour eux la vie se finissait à la
mort et il n'y avait point de résurrection

373
00:26:21,481 --> 00:26:24,117
pas de retour, pas
de réincarnation

374
00:26:25,752 --> 00:26:28,956
Maintenant Muhammad leur dit, vous
vous rappelez de ce Dieu dont on a parlé ?

375
00:26:29,189 --> 00:26:32,159
A votre mort vous ne
disaparaîtrez pas simplement

376
00:26:32,726 --> 00:26:35,162
Vous devrez vous
justifier devant ce Dieu

377
00:26:35,162 --> 00:26:36,830
pour les bonnes et les mauvaises actions

378
00:26:39,533 --> 00:26:43,704
Il apportait des notions morales,
éthiques et sociales à sa tribu

379
00:26:44,438 --> 00:26:49,743
L'idée qu'on est tous dans le même bateau
face à Dieu, qu'on doit bien se traîter

380
00:26:49,943 --> 00:26:53,480
faire preuve de compassion,
d'équité et de justice

381
00:26:55,616 --> 00:26:59,052
La révélation reçue par Muhammad
sur la montagne de lumière

382
00:26:59,386 --> 00:27:02,890
était la première d'une
série qu'il allait recevoir

383
00:27:03,023 --> 00:27:04,358
pour le reste de sa vie.

384
00:27:05,759 --> 00:27:09,162
La révélation ne vient pas d'un coup

385
00:27:09,863 --> 00:27:12,165
Elle ne descend pas du
ciel en mode "voici le livre"

386
00:27:13,066 --> 00:27:14,968
Maintenant va et prêche aux gens

387
00:27:16,336 --> 00:27:18,238
Elle descend progressivement

388
00:27:18,705 --> 00:27:22,309
Elle descend alors que
les événements arrivent

389
00:27:23,343 --> 00:27:24,845
Elle donne une explication,

390
00:27:24,978 --> 00:27:29,082
et surtout elle descend à un
rythme qu'il est capable de suivre

391
00:27:29,416 --> 00:27:31,818
Car l'idée est que cette
chose est si massive

392
00:27:31,985 --> 00:27:33,487
Elle est si énorme

393
00:27:33,887 --> 00:27:37,157
qu'il est impossible de
tout lui donner d'un coup

394
00:27:37,324 --> 00:27:38,525
Il va falloir du temps

395
00:27:38,859 --> 00:27:43,063
Il disait n'avoir jamais eu de révélation

396
00:27:43,263 --> 00:27:46,733
qui ne lui avait pas fait sentir
comme son âme se déchirer

397
00:27:49,136 --> 00:27:51,071
Il pouvait être assis, à cheval

398
00:27:51,071 --> 00:27:52,873
il pouvait marcher, il pouvait
être en train de discuter

399
00:27:53,373 --> 00:27:55,442
D'un coup il était saisi
par le Divin message

400
00:27:57,911 --> 00:28:00,013
Il sentait un grand
poids descendre sur lui

401
00:28:02,082 --> 00:28:05,052
Il transpirerait beaucoup,
même si il faisait froid

402
00:28:07,221 --> 00:28:10,824
Parfois il décrit la chose
comme le son d'une cloche

403
00:28:11,158 --> 00:28:14,995
Et il ajouta que ceci était le plus dur
à supporter, ce n'étaient pas les mots

404
00:28:15,429 --> 00:28:19,700
Mais le fait qu'il lui fallait écouter très
intensément pour capter le sens des mots

405
00:28:20,133 --> 00:28:25,939
de cette communication
Divine qui passait par lui

406
00:28:27,574 --> 00:28:30,244
Après avoir reçu chaque révélation,

407
00:28:30,444 --> 00:28:32,846
il irait la professer
aux gens autour de lui

408
00:28:33,113 --> 00:28:35,115
qui la transmettraient
à la communauté.

409
00:28:36,450 --> 00:28:39,753
Lorsque le prophète,
incapable de lire ou d'écrire

410
00:28:40,053 --> 00:28:43,090
commença à révéler
les versets du Coran

411
00:28:43,090 --> 00:28:45,325
il acquis de la crédibilité

412
00:28:45,759 --> 00:28:49,596
à cause de la nature même
des mots qu'ils contenaient

413
00:28:50,764 --> 00:28:53,066
Les gens y regarderaient
de plus près et diraient

414
00:28:53,066 --> 00:28:56,870
ces mots ne peuvent être le travail
d'un Homme. Il n'a pas pu tout inventer.

415
00:29:16,423 --> 00:29:21,762
Le Coran présente une
énonciation extraordinairement belle

416
00:29:22,496 --> 00:29:25,365
Ce n'est pas traduisible

417
00:29:25,766 --> 00:29:28,669
mais l'Arabe utilisé est extraordinaire

418
00:29:31,638 --> 00:29:34,808
Lorsque les premiers
musulmans entendirent le Coran

419
00:29:35,108 --> 00:29:40,914
beaucoup d'entre eux se mirent directement
à accepter le message du Prophète

420
00:29:41,715 --> 00:29:45,770
Pas forcément pour le contenu
mais du fait de la beauté des versets

421
00:29:50,123 --> 00:29:53,527
La révélation arrivait
dans une société

422
00:29:53,894 --> 00:29:56,797
où certaines personnes étaient
des mémorisateurs professionnels

423
00:29:58,031 --> 00:30:01,168
Ils entendaient une chose une
fois et ensuite pouvaient la répéter

424
00:30:02,836 --> 00:30:07,040
Les paroles de Muhammad
ont ainsi pu être préservées

425
00:30:07,341 --> 00:30:10,577
immédiatement dans la
mémoire des mémorisateurs

426
00:30:10,711 --> 00:30:14,214
et dans celle de ceux
capables de prendre des notes.

427
00:30:15,082 --> 00:30:16,950
Le corpus que nous
appelons aujourd'hui le Coran

428
00:30:17,351 --> 00:30:21,154
représente un ensemble
complet de ces versets

429
00:30:21,321 --> 00:30:25,292
que Muhammad a prononcé lorsqu'il
disait qu'ils étaient la révélation Divine

430
00:30:28,562 --> 00:30:30,264
Tout ce qu'on a sur le prophète,

431
00:30:31,164 --> 00:30:34,468
et tout ce que l'on a de la
révélation Divine, ce sont des mots

432
00:30:35,335 --> 00:30:36,403
Nous avons aucune image.

433
00:30:37,037 --> 00:30:38,405
Nous avons aucune statue.

434
00:30:38,705 --> 00:30:40,440
Tout ce qui nous reste, ce sont les mots.

435
00:30:41,808 --> 00:30:45,445
A partir de ces mots,
via l'art de la calligraphie

436
00:30:45,779 --> 00:30:48,382
nous pouvons les rendre
resplendissants, et plus accessibles

437
00:30:49,716 --> 00:30:54,321
Pour Mohamed Zakariya,
les mots sont à la base d'un art.

438
00:30:55,522 --> 00:30:56,857
Pour prévenir l'idôlaterie

439
00:30:57,157 --> 00:31:02,296
Muhammad interdit la création
d'images de lui ou des autres prophètes

440
00:31:03,197 --> 00:31:06,934
Ainsi la calligraphie devint
l'art le plus poussé de l'Islam.

441
00:31:08,702 --> 00:31:12,472
Parmi les textes sacrés réalisés
par Zakariya se trouve la Hilye (حلية )

442
00:31:12,706 --> 00:31:14,975
une description du
prophète par les mots.

443
00:31:16,143 --> 00:31:20,047
Elle nous vient d'Ali, qui, quand on lui
demandait de décrire le prophète, disait:

444
00:31:20,747 --> 00:31:23,016
Son visage était ni fin, ni rond

445
00:31:23,517 --> 00:31:25,219
mais il était
quelque peu arrondi.

446
00:31:26,082 --> 00:31:27,320
Quand il regardait quelqu'un

447
00:31:27,521 --> 00:31:30,490
il le regardait avec son visage
tourné parfaitement vers lui.

448
00:31:31,625 --> 00:31:34,361
Tout ceux qui le voyaient
étaient sans le vouloir, ébahis

449
00:31:34,962 --> 00:31:37,764
et quiconque partageait
sa compagnie, l'appréciait

450
00:31:38,532 --> 00:31:40,534
Tout ceux qui le décrivaient disaient:

451
00:31:40,534 --> 00:31:44,204
'Jamais avant de le croiser
n'ais-je vu quelqu'un comme lui'

452
00:31:44,638 --> 00:31:45,606
Que la paix soit sur lui

453
00:31:47,474 --> 00:31:49,343
Voici la Hilye la plus connue.

454
00:31:49,643 --> 00:31:53,712
Elle décrit si bien les
qualités de la personne

455
00:31:54,147 --> 00:31:58,185
que l'on peut presque la voir
de nos yeux, on la visualise

456
00:32:01,021 --> 00:32:04,024
Je vois ça comme avoir un petit

457
00:32:04,625 --> 00:32:07,160
post-it sur le prophète à
côté de moi, pour le regarder

458
00:32:07,227 --> 00:32:08,795
et se rappeler de lui
de temps en temps.

459
00:32:10,964 --> 00:32:14,468
Bien sûr, il n'est pas
avec nous, mais la hilye

460
00:32:15,035 --> 00:32:16,856
elle le rapproche,
rapproche sa présence

461
00:32:19,540 --> 00:32:24,678
Muhammad a toujours insisté sur le
fait qu'il n'était pas une figure Divine

462
00:32:25,179 --> 00:32:29,650
et s'est efforcé de prévenir ses
disciples de ne pas faire de lui

463
00:32:29,650 --> 00:32:34,154
ce que les Chrétiens avaient fait de Jesus,
de le mettre sur un pied d'estal et dire

464
00:32:34,154 --> 00:32:35,923
qu'il est Dieu ou au
moins d'essence Divine

465
00:32:35,923 --> 00:32:40,928
Il n'était pas Divin, c'était un humain ordinaire,
et les musulmans ont pris ça très au sérieux

466
00:32:42,629 --> 00:32:45,832
Mais ce qu'ils disent est que
Muhammad est l'homme idéal.

467
00:32:47,234 --> 00:32:49,036
Que si l'on regarde sa vie

468
00:32:49,336 --> 00:32:55,108
on peut voir comment l'on
peut se rendre pleinement à Dieu

469
00:33:01,148 --> 00:33:04,818
"L'enseignement de Muhammad
commença à attirer des disciples"

470
00:33:05,285 --> 00:33:09,389
surtout parmi les opprimés
de la société Mecquoise.

471
00:33:11,131 --> 00:33:16,537
Ce sont les gens qui n'ont
plus rien à perdre et tout à gagner

472
00:33:16,730 --> 00:33:19,099
Ce sont eux qui
répondent à l'appel

473
00:33:20,067 --> 00:33:23,804
Beaucoup des disciples
sont les pauvres, les esclaves,

474
00:33:24,171 --> 00:33:25,839
les femmes sans protection.

475
00:33:26,139 --> 00:33:29,610
La nouvelle se répand parmis
les déshérités de la Mecque

476
00:33:30,944 --> 00:33:33,914
Le prophète Muhammad
a remarqué qu'il

477
00:33:34,181 --> 00:33:36,683
vivait dans une société qui
ne respectait pas les femmes.

478
00:33:37,484 --> 00:33:41,288
Elles étaient vues comme
étant des personnes inférieures

479
00:33:41,555 --> 00:33:46,927
un objet, ou une possession
qui appartient à l'homme.

480
00:33:47,628 --> 00:33:49,863
Et celà dérangeait le prophète.

481
00:33:51,932 --> 00:33:56,770
Très tôt dans sa vie prophétique, le prophète
dénonça l'infanticide des bébés filles

482
00:33:59,139 --> 00:34:02,576
Des révélations plus tard allaient donner
aux femmes des droits dans le mariage

483
00:34:02,776 --> 00:34:06,446
le droit de divorcer, une
garantie de leur droit à l'héritage

484
00:34:07,748 --> 00:34:11,318
Il est bien sur anachronique et
absurde de considérer le prophète

485
00:34:11,318 --> 00:34:14,755
comme un féministe
au sens du 21e siècle.

486
00:34:15,289 --> 00:34:19,993
Il en reste que ce qu'il a fait pour les
femmes, dans son contexte, est impressionant.

487
00:34:21,495 --> 00:34:25,732
Même si la majorité des femmes dans
l'Arabie pré-Islamique étaient des objets

488
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:30,470
La femme de Muhammad,
Khadija, était riche et influente.

489
00:34:31,905 --> 00:34:35,642
Il y a cette idée que les femmes avant
l'Islam étaient vues comme du bêtail

490
00:34:35,876 --> 00:34:37,811
qu'elles n'avaient aucun droits

491
00:34:38,212 --> 00:34:43,584
Et je pense que pour de nombreuses
femmes, c'était le cas, mais

492
00:34:43,851 --> 00:34:47,254
à un certain niveau de la société,
celui de Khadija par exemple

493
00:34:47,554 --> 00:34:48,589
ce n'était pas le cas.

494
00:34:50,457 --> 00:34:53,794
Khadija est une source d'instpiration car

495
00:34:53,961 --> 00:34:57,764
malgré la société masculine dans
laquelle elle vivait, elle travaillait.

496
00:34:58,632 --> 00:35:03,470
Il y a donc des parallèles que les femmes
actuelles peuvent faire, en suivant son exemple

497
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:07,508
J'ai grandi dans le
Cachemire (Pakistan)

498
00:35:07,808 --> 00:35:11,445
which is in the foothills
of the Himalayas, northern India.

499
00:35:12,112 --> 00:35:15,482
And I came to America when
I was 15 years old.

500
00:35:16,817 --> 00:35:20,554
As I started becoming part and
parcel of this culture and society

501
00:35:21,021 --> 00:35:25,225
I gravitated towards just wanting
to be like everybody else.

502
00:35:25,726 --> 00:35:28,195
And tended to stray away
from my own faith.

503
00:35:29,496 --> 00:35:32,533
And for awhile there
I went through some very

504
00:35:32,666 --> 00:35:34,535
dark stages in my life

505
00:35:34,935 --> 00:35:38,872
where I wanted nothing
to do with my faith

506
00:35:40,474 --> 00:35:44,111
and almost just walked away
from my faith.

507
00:35:45,112 --> 00:35:47,080
As I got older

508
00:35:47,581 --> 00:35:52,085
I recognized that there was
this very empty hole inside of me.

509
00:35:54,555 --> 00:35:58,825
So I started searching
for God in all kinds of places.

510
00:35:59,359 --> 00:36:01,728
You know Rumi has this beautiful
story where he says

511
00:36:02,362 --> 00:36:05,899
I looked for God, I went to a temple,
and I didn't find him there.

512
00:36:06,266 --> 00:36:08,635
Then I went to a church and
I didn't find him there.

513
00:36:08,635 --> 00:36:11,238
And then I went to a mosque and
I didn't find him there.

514
00:36:11,572 --> 00:36:14,208
"And then finally I looked
in my heart and there he was. "

515
00:36:19,079 --> 00:36:22,850
The challenges that I faced in my life
are the very same challenges

516
00:36:22,850 --> 00:36:24,852
that a lot of young girls are facing.

517
00:36:25,686 --> 00:36:28,455
And, when they come to me
with their questions

518
00:36:28,789 --> 00:36:32,192
I feel like a person who has already
traveled the road.

519
00:36:34,294 --> 00:36:36,063
I dispense advice to them

520
00:36:36,163 --> 00:36:39,666
from real experience as to how
I would have dealt with something.

521
00:36:39,933 --> 00:36:42,002
I've noticed how when it comes to women

522
00:36:42,102 --> 00:36:44,605
we are only supposed to marry Muslim men.

523
00:36:45,072 --> 00:36:46,139
Uh, why is that now?

524
00:36:46,139 --> 00:36:49,309
Especially because the Quran says that

525
00:36:49,309 --> 00:36:51,078
believing men and women should marry

526
00:36:51,078 --> 00:36:52,479
believing men and women, it doesn't

527
00:36:52,679 --> 00:36:55,182
point out that men can marry
such and women can't.

528
00:36:55,415 --> 00:36:58,619
I've heard plenty of people say that
in fact that's an interpretation.

529
00:36:59,386 --> 00:37:01,455
Some of the issues are deeply personal

530
00:37:01,788 --> 00:37:04,057
ah issues with gender relations

531
00:37:04,224 --> 00:37:08,495
like dating and ah marriage.

532
00:37:09,963 --> 00:37:12,332
And other issues have to do with

533
00:37:12,633 --> 00:37:16,703
you know certain Islamic law and how
to reconcile with some of those things.

534
00:37:17,437 --> 00:37:19,640
I want to exchange with her. See?
Her's is prettier

535
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:23,710
And these are all sticky
wickets as we say.

536
00:37:24,912 --> 00:37:28,248
The fact that I've walked
the walk helps a little bit

537
00:37:28,582 --> 00:37:30,984
for me to dispense advice to these people.

538
00:37:52,773 --> 00:37:55,742
In Mecca,
opposition to Muhammad was growing.

539
00:37:57,711 --> 00:38:01,849
His message of monotheism and
his campaign against idolatry

540
00:38:02,416 --> 00:38:06,086
threatened the lucrative trade that
fueled the Meccan economy.

541
00:38:07,621 --> 00:38:10,858
The business of Mecca is
to draw pilgrims to Mecca.

542
00:38:11,124 --> 00:38:12,292
They want to make money.

543
00:38:12,392 --> 00:38:16,430
And the way they draw pilgrims to Mecca is,
people come visit their gods.

544
00:38:16,463 --> 00:38:20,334
Well, here's somebody who is saying,
these gods, they are not real.

545
00:38:20,434 --> 00:38:22,336
They're stones, they're rocks.

546
00:38:22,603 --> 00:38:24,705
You're wasting your time.

547
00:38:24,905 --> 00:38:29,510
Now, that message has economic
implications to the Quraysh.

548
00:38:29,776 --> 00:38:30,878
They are worried.

549
00:38:30,978 --> 00:38:34,114
This, this man is going
to undermine our business.

550
00:38:36,316 --> 00:38:41,054
In the tribal system Muhammad was
protected by his uncle, Abu Talib

551
00:38:43,023 --> 00:38:48,262
so the Meccans went to Abu Talib and
asked him to turn Muhammad over to them.

552
00:38:50,197 --> 00:38:52,866
Abu Talib was in a difficult position.

553
00:38:52,866 --> 00:38:54,134
He was not a Muslim.

554
00:38:54,935 --> 00:38:57,738
But it went against the grain

555
00:38:57,738 --> 00:39:00,674
for him to simply hand
over his beloved nephew

556
00:39:00,807 --> 00:39:03,710
to these people who would
kill him with impunity.

557
00:39:04,178 --> 00:39:07,714
So he took Muhammad to one side and
said look don't do this.

558
00:39:07,714 --> 00:39:10,284
Don't do this to us.
Can't you just keep quiet?

559
00:39:11,118 --> 00:39:13,654
And at that point the Prophet says

560
00:39:13,820 --> 00:39:18,225
if they put the sun in my right
hand and the moon in my left hand

561
00:39:18,725 --> 00:39:22,996
I will not stop preaching
what I am preaching

562
00:39:22,996 --> 00:39:27,801
until this message is conveyed or
I die conveying it.

563
00:39:28,235 --> 00:39:32,172
And this is what he tells his uncle and
at that point he begins to weep.

564
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:38,579
And his Uncle looks at him and
realizes the depth of the conviction

565
00:39:38,579 --> 00:39:44,418
of this man and he says say whatever
you want, you have my protection.

566
00:39:47,354 --> 00:39:50,924
One of the things that
the prophet Muhammad S.A.W. taught us

567
00:39:52,259 --> 00:39:54,828
was that it is our duty

568
00:39:55,395 --> 00:39:57,764
to try to correct injustices in the world.

569
00:40:00,167 --> 00:40:03,470
If you see something wrong,
change it with your hands.

570
00:40:05,305 --> 00:40:08,709
If you're not able to,
then speak out against it.

571
00:40:10,310 --> 00:40:14,181
If you're not able to do that,
then feel bad about it in your heart.

572
00:40:15,349 --> 00:40:17,451
But that is the weakest form of faith.

573
00:40:18,785 --> 00:40:22,456
Wherever possible the Muslim
should try to take action.

574
00:40:23,290 --> 00:40:25,592
And not let an injustice go by

575
00:40:26,393 --> 00:40:30,464
without calling it what it is,
and asking for change.

576
00:40:33,534 --> 00:40:34,902
What do we have?

577
00:40:35,569 --> 00:40:36,904
The book's prepared for the week.

578
00:40:37,037 --> 00:40:40,607
Dealing with change is part of
Jameel Johnson's job.

579
00:40:41,175 --> 00:40:44,444
As Chief-of-Staff for
Congressman Gregory Meeks of New York

580
00:40:44,845 --> 00:40:49,349
he manages the congressman's schedule,
and briefs him on policy issues.

581
00:40:49,683 --> 00:40:51,451
The biggest problem with the bill

582
00:40:51,952 --> 00:40:55,422
is that there's the issue
of discrimination using federal funds.

583
00:40:55,556 --> 00:40:57,024
Because it's not like a private plan.

584
00:40:57,057 --> 00:40:59,193
So you're telling me that
you recommend a no vote.

585
00:41:00,093 --> 00:41:01,328
I'm recommending a no vote.

586
00:41:01,461 --> 00:41:02,529
As we had said in the beginning

587
00:41:03,397 --> 00:41:05,732
I'm gonna give you the technical
part and what I think the issue is

588
00:41:06,133 --> 00:41:07,334
you take care of the politics.

589
00:41:08,135 --> 00:41:09,469
- Good deal...
- What else do we have?

590
00:41:10,037 --> 00:41:13,340
My goal is not necessarily
to simply seek votes or

591
00:41:13,974 --> 00:41:19,213
campaign money or to be accepted
as a part of the game.

592
00:41:19,746 --> 00:41:23,317
As Muslims we must seek justice,
so what I try to do is educate.

593
00:41:24,651 --> 00:41:26,687
In many cases the best thing
that you are able to do

594
00:41:26,687 --> 00:41:28,889
with that kind of education
is decrease prejudice

595
00:41:29,623 --> 00:41:30,891
and increase understanding.

596
00:41:32,726 --> 00:41:35,329
If I practice my Islam on the job

597
00:41:36,129 --> 00:41:38,098
and do that without trying to interfere

598
00:41:38,265 --> 00:41:41,134
with anyone else's practice,
whether they be religious or otherwise

599
00:41:41,602 --> 00:41:43,971
then I make it easier for the next
Muslim that comes on board.

600
00:41:45,506 --> 00:41:47,441
Especially also if I do a good job

601
00:41:48,375 --> 00:41:51,411
because then some of the prejudice,
some of the misunderstanding goes away.

602
00:41:57,584 --> 00:42:02,356
Johnson coordinates the Friday
prayer service, or Jumah, on Capitol Hill.

603
00:42:03,790 --> 00:42:10,130
It's grown since we started it,
it used to be sometimes 3, 5, 10 of us.

604
00:42:10,564 --> 00:42:13,767
Now there can be up to 40, 50 people.
We're...

605
00:42:14,168 --> 00:42:15,869
busting out of the room that we're in.

606
00:42:16,737 --> 00:42:19,239
It's kind of a re-energizing

607
00:42:19,506 --> 00:42:23,911
kind of refilling our fuel tank
with faith again for the rest of the week.

608
00:42:24,945 --> 00:42:27,781
The image of the messenger

609
00:42:28,315 --> 00:42:32,352
that gives us an example of somebody
who is extremely successful

610
00:42:33,053 --> 00:42:38,258
as a head of state nevertheless he never
had to compromise his integrity.

611
00:42:44,264 --> 00:42:47,367
One of the most important
things for a Muslim

612
00:42:48,068 --> 00:42:50,938
is remaining constantly
in remembrance of Allah.

613
00:42:52,105 --> 00:42:56,577
What we are commanded to do is that
we make, formal prayer 5 times a day.

614
00:42:57,845 --> 00:42:59,780
Because when you live in a society

615
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:02,316
that constantly gives
you acceptance and praise

616
00:43:02,683 --> 00:43:05,786
because of material things or achievement

617
00:43:06,553 --> 00:43:09,957
we need that constant remembrance of Allah

618
00:43:10,123 --> 00:43:13,227
in order to bring us back to the right path.

619
00:43:13,794 --> 00:43:16,763
As some say, keeping our eyes on the prize.

620
00:43:17,431 --> 00:43:19,433
And prayer is that remembrance.

621
00:43:21,668 --> 00:43:25,072
Even though Islam isn't
the biggest faith in America

622
00:43:26,673 --> 00:43:29,776
even though it sometimes is ridiculed

623
00:43:31,144 --> 00:43:33,614
the fact of the matter is
that I can practice

624
00:43:34,848 --> 00:43:36,483
I can make my five prayers a day.

625
00:43:38,085 --> 00:43:39,486
It was much harder

626
00:43:39,586 --> 00:43:43,390
for the Messenger of Allah S.A. W and
his companions to do this.

627
00:43:47,461 --> 00:43:50,230
The first Muslims faced
a torrent of ridicule

628
00:43:50,230 --> 00:43:52,099
and abuse when they practiced
Islam in public.

629
00:43:56,803 --> 00:43:59,306
Attacked by crowds throwing stones

630
00:43:59,306 --> 00:44:02,743
they retreated to the surrounding
mountains to pray in secret.

631
00:44:05,245 --> 00:44:09,750
Many pagan families split apart
when their children converted to Islam.

632
00:44:12,286 --> 00:44:15,722
Finally, the leaders of Muhammad's tribe,
the Quraysh

633
00:44:15,722 --> 00:44:19,593
decided that Harassment alone
would not be enough to stop him.

634
00:44:20,327 --> 00:44:24,131
The Quraysh, they see it as
our honor is being threatened

635
00:44:24,298 --> 00:44:25,699
we need to deal with this.

636
00:44:26,700 --> 00:44:30,504
This is the point where they begin
to really increase their persecution

637
00:44:30,504 --> 00:44:32,039
they start sanctions

638
00:44:32,739 --> 00:44:36,510
on the house of Beni Hashim,
which is the sub-clan of the

639
00:44:36,510 --> 00:44:37,444
Prophet Muhammad.

640
00:44:37,477 --> 00:44:43,550
They begin to prevent them from trading,
from transacting.

641
00:44:43,817 --> 00:44:46,587
And that meant that basically
they were being starved out.

642
00:44:46,587 --> 00:44:48,822
They couldn't buy food,
they couldn't do business.

643
00:44:48,922 --> 00:44:51,892
Abu Talib ah was ruined by this.

644
00:44:53,126 --> 00:44:57,364
The Hashim lived in one street and Muhammad

645
00:44:57,364 --> 00:45:01,068
and Khadija and the children
moved into this street.

646
00:45:01,368 --> 00:45:03,904
And this became a little Muslim ghetto.

647
00:45:05,005 --> 00:45:06,573
And this leads to real hardship.

648
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:09,276
There's a period of time where
according to the tradition

649
00:45:09,276 --> 00:45:12,145
they're actually eating
from the leaves of trees.

650
00:45:13,347 --> 00:45:16,116
Famine destroyed
the fortunes of Muhammad's

651
00:45:16,116 --> 00:45:19,686
protector, Abu Talib,
and his follower Abu Bakr.

652
00:45:21,321 --> 00:45:25,592
The survival of both the clan and
Islam were in jeopardy.

653
00:45:28,028 --> 00:45:32,366
But for Muhammad the damage
hit even closer to home.

654
00:45:33,233 --> 00:45:36,370
Khadija, Muhammad's beloved wife, uh

655
00:45:36,370 --> 00:45:40,674
perhaps weakened by the privations,
actually died.

656
00:45:42,309 --> 00:45:45,546
And that was just
a crippling blow for him.

657
00:45:45,746 --> 00:45:49,183
Left him feeling alone and
vulnerable and weak.

658
00:45:50,017 --> 00:45:52,452
He would miss her all his life,
I think.

659
00:45:55,088 --> 00:45:58,959
Then the catastrophe happened
that Abu Talib died.

660
00:45:59,860 --> 00:46:03,497
Perhaps himself weakened
by the deprivation in food.

661
00:46:04,965 --> 00:46:07,067
Now without Abu Talib

662
00:46:07,568 --> 00:46:10,204
Muhammad was fair game for assassination.

663
00:46:12,272 --> 00:46:14,808
And there's a terrible moment where

664
00:46:14,842 --> 00:46:16,944
he utters this heart breaking prayer

665
00:46:17,177 --> 00:46:20,781
saying oh my god I have no other
protector but you, Allah.

666
00:46:21,348 --> 00:46:23,784
And how was he going to move forward?

667
00:46:24,985 --> 00:46:28,155
He'd done what Allah had told him to do.

668
00:46:28,155 --> 00:46:30,057
He had proclaimed this message and

669
00:46:30,057 --> 00:46:33,961
all that he seemed to have done was
stir up hostility and hatred.

670
00:46:34,361 --> 00:46:37,564
Um and split his tribe down the middle

671
00:46:37,564 --> 00:46:39,333
this wasn't improving matters.

672
00:46:39,967 --> 00:46:44,805
He must have felt an almost,
a sort of a dark night of the soul.

673
00:46:45,339 --> 00:46:48,909
He is at the low point of his mission.

674
00:46:49,076 --> 00:46:53,313
He's been almost 13 years now in Mecca and

675
00:46:53,313 --> 00:46:58,752
the results are not,
they are not impressive.

676
00:47:01,021 --> 00:47:03,156
But at this point, at this low ebb

677
00:47:03,390 --> 00:47:06,560
he is now being prepared

678
00:47:06,627 --> 00:47:09,596
for the most extraordinary
mystical experience

679
00:47:09,763 --> 00:47:11,832
of his prophetic life

680
00:47:11,965 --> 00:47:15,802
and that is what is known
as the night ascension.

681
00:47:18,038 --> 00:47:21,708
The story goes that one night
he was sleeping near the Ka'aba

682
00:47:22,643 --> 00:47:26,346
and he was woken from sleep by Gabriel

683
00:47:26,780 --> 00:47:30,784
who mounted him on a Buraq

684
00:47:30,784 --> 00:47:33,453
a magical stead

685
00:47:34,254 --> 00:47:38,292
and they flew from Mecca to Jerusalem.

686
00:47:43,063 --> 00:47:45,599
And then he began an ascent.

687
00:47:45,832 --> 00:47:49,036
Up through the seven heavens
to the divine throne

688
00:47:49,603 --> 00:47:54,875
at every stage of the heavens
he meets various prophets of the past.

689
00:47:55,008 --> 00:47:59,546
He meets Abraham, he meets Jesus,
and John the Baptist.

690
00:47:59,980 --> 00:48:01,548
He meets Moses

691
00:48:03,050 --> 00:48:06,720
and finally he enters into
the divine presence and there

692
00:48:07,020 --> 00:48:09,957
the sources are silent
because when you enter

693
00:48:09,957 --> 00:48:12,626
into the presence of God
you have gone beyond words.

694
00:48:13,460 --> 00:48:18,065
And he receives from God,
the highest form of knowledge and truth

695
00:48:18,799 --> 00:48:22,936
and many injunctions of the religion
itself including the final form

696
00:48:23,437 --> 00:48:28,141
of the daily prayers
Now all of this took place

697
00:48:28,976 --> 00:48:30,777
in a time beyond time.

698
00:48:31,512 --> 00:48:34,681
That's why some sources say
that as the door was

699
00:48:34,681 --> 00:48:37,584
swinging when he left,
it was still swinging when he came back.

700
00:48:39,152 --> 00:48:43,123
For later Muslims this also
meant that the departure point

701
00:48:44,091 --> 00:48:49,263
that is Jerusalem, the Dome of the Rock,
became also important.

702
00:48:50,464 --> 00:48:54,735
Many Muslims say that there are
three holy cities in Islam:

703
00:48:54,801 --> 00:48:59,106
Mecca, and Medina, the City of the Prophet,
and Jerusalem.

704
00:49:01,441 --> 00:49:04,211
When he comes back somebody asks him

705
00:49:04,678 --> 00:49:08,482
what have you been doing, he says
I went to Jerusalem last night

706
00:49:08,815 --> 00:49:11,985
and this man says,
you went to Jerusalem last night?

707
00:49:12,186 --> 00:49:14,087
Are you willing to say that publicly?

708
00:49:15,088 --> 00:49:19,560
So they assemble this group and
they tell him, describe for us

709
00:49:19,860 --> 00:49:23,964
Jerusalem and he begins
to describe it in very exact detail.

710
00:49:25,032 --> 00:49:25,999
And they're shocked.

711
00:49:25,999 --> 00:49:27,868
They don't what to make of this now.

712
00:49:29,403 --> 00:49:33,540
The story of the Night Journey not
only incited Muhammad's enemies.

713
00:49:33,941 --> 00:49:37,044
It caused doubt even among
some of his followers.

714
00:49:38,679 --> 00:49:41,882
This is something that
they hadn't really expected.

715
00:49:42,049 --> 00:49:44,585
A journey that takes them
a month to be made

716
00:49:44,785 --> 00:49:46,987
in an evening and to come back.

717
00:49:47,754 --> 00:49:50,023
What Abu Bakr says is listen

718
00:49:50,023 --> 00:49:53,126
I believe that he's getting
messages from God.

719
00:49:53,293 --> 00:49:57,731
That is certainly more extraordinary
than making a Night Journey to Jerusalem.

720
00:49:59,266 --> 00:50:03,036
As Muhammad's relationship with
the Meccans continued to deteriorate

721
00:50:03,270 --> 00:50:07,841
his enemies decided that the time
had come to eliminate him.

722
00:50:10,577 --> 00:50:13,514
And they decide to get
a youth from each clan.

723
00:50:13,780 --> 00:50:17,584
They all come together and they're going
to strike him with one blow together.

724
00:50:17,651 --> 00:50:21,088
So, the blood is distributed
amongst all the clans.

725
00:50:23,423 --> 00:50:27,995
Under cover of darkness the assassins
surrounded Muhammad's home.

726
00:50:30,564 --> 00:50:32,866
Inside a covered figure lay asleep.

727
00:50:33,967 --> 00:50:36,870
As dawn broke, they prepared to strike.

728
00:50:38,138 --> 00:50:41,175
But Muhammad had been
forewarned of the plot.

729
00:50:41,875 --> 00:50:43,544
He asked his cousin Ali

730
00:50:43,877 --> 00:50:47,347
whom he knew the Quraysh would not harm,
to take his place.

731
00:50:48,315 --> 00:50:50,984
By the time the assassins
burst into his home

732
00:50:51,151 --> 00:50:55,889
Muhammad and his companion Abu Bakr
had escaped into the desert.

733
00:51:00,027 --> 00:51:01,895
With the Meccans in hot pursuit

734
00:51:02,229 --> 00:51:05,299
they set out on a circuitous
route to the oasis

735
00:51:05,399 --> 00:51:09,503
settlement of Yathrib,
250 miles to the north.

736
00:51:10,904 --> 00:51:13,473
For several months,
Muhammad had been sending

737
00:51:13,473 --> 00:51:15,642
his followers there for refuge.

738
00:51:16,743 --> 00:51:18,979
Now, he was about to join them.

739
00:51:19,713 --> 00:51:22,482
Yathrib was quite different from Mecca.

740
00:51:23,116 --> 00:51:24,985
It was an agricultural settlement.

741
00:51:24,985 --> 00:51:29,690
People grew dates and they had
farms and there were a number

742
00:51:29,690 --> 00:51:33,160
of clans and tribes living
together in the settlement.

743
00:51:37,064 --> 00:51:42,536
The settlement was engulfed
in tribal warfare of the worst kind.

744
00:51:42,536 --> 00:51:45,105
It was an example of where the whole

745
00:51:45,105 --> 00:51:48,275
system in Arabia was beginning
to break down.

746
00:51:48,575 --> 00:51:53,981
One killing led to another and nobody
could seem to find a solution.

747
00:51:54,948 --> 00:51:57,985
Nobody, that is,
until the clans of Yathrib

748
00:51:57,985 --> 00:52:00,153
heard about the trustworthy Muhammad.

749
00:52:00,854 --> 00:52:03,690
Hoping he could unify its warring factions

750
00:52:03,824 --> 00:52:07,327
which included two major pagan
tribes and their Jewish allies

751
00:52:07,528 --> 00:52:10,831
a delegation from Yathrib
had taken the dramatic step

752
00:52:11,064 --> 00:52:13,934
of inviting Muhammad
to move to their settlement.

753
00:52:14,768 --> 00:52:18,405
The deal is that he will serve
as their binding arbitrator

754
00:52:18,672 --> 00:52:21,875
that is both sides
to the conflict have agreed

755
00:52:21,975 --> 00:52:25,279
already that they will accept
the arbitration of Muhammad

756
00:52:25,379 --> 00:52:26,580
whatever it would be.

757
00:52:27,514 --> 00:52:31,652
The people of Yathrib vowed
that they would take

758
00:52:31,652 --> 00:52:36,123
the Muslims on board as honorary
tribesmen, they would be their protectors.

759
00:52:36,256 --> 00:52:39,193
Anyone who hurt the Muslims,
they would retaliate.

760
00:52:39,226 --> 00:52:41,728
And the Muslims agreed to do the same.

761
00:52:42,696 --> 00:52:46,600
This move from your tribe

762
00:52:47,367 --> 00:52:51,338
to join up with people who were of no kin

763
00:52:51,338 --> 00:52:54,808
to you at all was absolutely unheard of.

764
00:52:55,609 --> 00:52:58,645
Muhammad was really going off
into the wilderness here

765
00:52:58,645 --> 00:53:00,914
he was breaking every tie.

766
00:53:01,114 --> 00:53:04,151
Doing something utterly
shocking and novel.

767
00:53:06,753 --> 00:53:11,558
When Prophet Muhammad was leaving
he stood up on a hill

768
00:53:12,059 --> 00:53:14,695
and he was looking on Mecca

769
00:53:15,262 --> 00:53:18,432
and his tears were coming
down out of his eyes.

770
00:53:18,899 --> 00:53:23,337
And he talked to Mecca and he said
God knows that I love you Mecca

771
00:53:23,337 --> 00:53:28,675
so much, but it is your people
who are chasing me out.

772
00:53:30,911 --> 00:53:35,115
In Yathrib, Muhammad's followers
anxiously awaited the Prophet's arrival.

773
00:53:35,716 --> 00:53:39,019
Had the man they hoped would
save them been able to save himself?

774
00:53:39,319 --> 00:53:41,755
Had the Meccans captured or
even killed him?

775
00:53:45,325 --> 00:53:48,262
When Muhammad finally reached
the outskirts of the city

776
00:53:48,662 --> 00:53:51,098
his relieved followers rushed to greet him

777
00:53:51,098 --> 00:53:55,702
with a song Muslims around
the world still sing 1400 years later.

778
00:54:06,113 --> 00:54:10,184
Oh the wise moon rose over us

779
00:54:10,350 --> 00:54:14,288
from the valley of Wadan.

780
00:54:14,521 --> 00:54:18,492
And we always do show gratefulness

781
00:54:18,692 --> 00:54:22,629
where the call is to Allah.

782
00:54:24,998 --> 00:54:28,302
Muhammad's arrival marked
the beginning of a dramatic

783
00:54:28,302 --> 00:54:30,671
new chapter in the history of Islam.

784
00:54:31,038 --> 00:54:32,139
For the first time

785
00:54:32,139 --> 00:54:34,875
he would be the leader
of a sovereign community

786
00:54:34,875 --> 00:54:36,743
based on Islamic law.

787
00:54:37,411 --> 00:54:40,681
Yathrib would henceforth
become known as Medina.

788
00:54:42,216 --> 00:54:44,351
Muhammad arrives in Medina as

789
00:54:44,351 --> 00:54:46,720
somebody who was escaping danger.

790
00:54:47,254 --> 00:54:50,924
He's been invited there but
he doesn't know what to expect...

791
00:54:53,126 --> 00:54:57,831
So at each stage of his life,
there's a new challenge

792
00:54:58,332 --> 00:55:01,935
and obviously,
new fears and new doubts.

793
00:55:02,536 --> 00:55:06,507
And so, he started thinking
in terms of policy.

794
00:55:06,874 --> 00:55:08,675
In terms of strategy.

795
00:55:09,009 --> 00:55:11,044
In terms of tactics.

796
00:55:12,379 --> 00:55:17,050
And that's what ultimately
made him into a statesman.

797
00:55:17,918 --> 00:55:19,920
Because that's what statesmen do.

798
00:55:20,354 --> 00:55:23,123
Now unlike Jesus, or the Buddha

799
00:55:23,123 --> 00:55:25,492
who seem to have been purely
spiritual leaders

800
00:55:25,492 --> 00:55:27,694
with no temporal responsibilities whatever

801
00:55:27,928 --> 00:55:30,330
MUHAMMAD found himself now head of state.

802
00:55:30,597 --> 00:55:33,634
Having transferred the Muslim families

803
00:55:34,001 --> 00:55:36,136
from MECCA to Medina.

804
00:55:36,570 --> 00:55:39,006
He now had to make sure
they could survive there.

805
00:55:39,873 --> 00:55:42,910
The survival of the fledgling
community depended on

806
00:55:42,910 --> 00:55:46,180
its ability to defend itself
against attacks from Mecca.

807
00:55:47,614 --> 00:55:49,750
To respond to this possibility

808
00:55:49,750 --> 00:55:52,786
Muhammad developed
a novel political solution.

809
00:55:54,288 --> 00:55:57,424
He essentially establishes
a pact, an agreement

810
00:55:57,424 --> 00:55:59,893
sometimes it's called
the Constitution Of Medina.

811
00:56:00,394 --> 00:56:02,696
Whether you were a Pagan or a Muslim

812
00:56:03,197 --> 00:56:06,400
or a member of the Jewish tribes or
any other tribes in Medina

813
00:56:06,733 --> 00:56:08,969
you had to sign on to this pact.

814
00:56:09,603 --> 00:56:11,805
And the pact established that

815
00:56:12,005 --> 00:56:15,309
if there were ever an attack
on Medina from the outside

816
00:56:15,609 --> 00:56:18,512
all the inhabitants of the town
of would be responsible

817
00:56:18,612 --> 00:56:20,314
to defend the city.

818
00:56:20,814 --> 00:56:25,619
This way, Muhammad really developed
a revolutionary idea

819
00:56:25,919 --> 00:56:29,990
which was transcend
your tribal responsibilities

820
00:56:29,990 --> 00:56:31,992
your petty particularism

821
00:56:32,125 --> 00:56:36,063
and begin to think in larger terms,
as a entire community.

822
00:56:37,831 --> 00:56:40,801
Now this was a very fearful terrifying

823
00:56:40,934 --> 00:56:43,504
time for Muslims but nevertheless

824
00:56:43,604 --> 00:56:46,940
it was seen as a creative time when
faith was at its strongest.

825
00:56:47,474 --> 00:56:52,412
It's a creative act for Muslims
to look back at the

826
00:56:52,513 --> 00:56:56,550
Muslim community in Medina and
try to apply the

827
00:56:56,750 --> 00:56:59,753
ideals to their own society
so that they can

828
00:56:59,753 --> 00:57:03,290
reproduce something of the Prophet's
original spirit.

829
00:57:06,994 --> 00:57:13,767
I came here to this country and
I came with a feeling that

830
00:57:13,834 --> 00:57:18,705
I left back in my original country
in Iraq many memories

831
00:57:18,739 --> 00:57:20,207
many painful memories

832
00:57:20,207 --> 00:57:24,244
one of them that my grandfather as well as

833
00:57:24,945 --> 00:57:26,880
13 members of all my family

834
00:57:26,947 --> 00:57:31,385
were persecuted and imprisoned
by the dictator Saddam Hussein.

835
00:57:31,785 --> 00:57:35,088
That reminds me of the agony and pain

836
00:57:35,489 --> 00:57:39,226
many early immigrants went through
when they came to Medina.

837
00:57:40,661 --> 00:57:44,998
Like many other Muslims who have fled
persecution in their native countries

838
00:57:45,232 --> 00:57:48,468
Imam Hassan Qazwini, was drawn to America

839
00:57:48,468 --> 00:57:52,072
by the promise of religious freedom and
economic opportunity.

840
00:57:56,176 --> 00:57:58,178
He emigrated to Dearborn Michigan

841
00:57:58,412 --> 00:58:00,013
a community that boasts the highest

842
00:58:00,047 --> 00:58:03,383
per capita concentration of Muslims
in the United States

843
00:58:03,817 --> 00:58:07,821
where people are almost as likely
to speak Arabic as English.

844
00:58:09,423 --> 00:58:13,627
Hijra, migration,
it has a shining aspect for me.

845
00:58:14,027 --> 00:58:16,096
As well as for the Prophet and his

846
00:58:16,096 --> 00:58:19,032
companions who came with him
from Mecca to Medina.

847
00:58:20,434 --> 00:58:23,036
And that shining aspect was the freedom

848
00:58:23,170 --> 00:58:25,839
religious freedom that they faced in Medina.

849
00:58:27,341 --> 00:58:31,645
Muslims here in America, they feel
they are more free in practicing

850
00:58:31,678 --> 00:58:35,382
their religion than many
other Muslim countries.

851
00:58:44,892 --> 00:58:49,163
In many ways this whole immigration
process from Mecca to Medina very much

852
00:58:49,229 --> 00:58:53,233
parallels what's happened in my own city
here in Dearborn, in our own backyard.

853
00:58:53,567 --> 00:58:55,802
And I see it play out in
the hospital where I work.

854
00:59:05,145 --> 00:59:09,249
Najah Bazzy is a nurse
at Dearborn's Oakwood Hospital.

855
00:59:09,750 --> 00:59:11,965
She conducts training sessions
to help bridge

856
00:59:11,965 --> 00:59:15,085
the gap of understanding between
the hospital staff

857
00:59:15,489 --> 00:59:19,226
and their Muslim patients,
many of whom are immigrants.

858
00:59:20,294 --> 00:59:22,596
I know you're all nurses, and I know

859
00:59:22,963 --> 00:59:27,167
that you're in this profession,
just as I am, to serve, to do a good job.

860
00:59:28,502 --> 00:59:30,871
But it's real easy for us to get
caught up in our own baggage.

861
00:59:31,104 --> 00:59:35,209
We're all human and we all have
a certain set of preconceived notions

862
00:59:35,542 --> 00:59:37,744
just as you walk through
the door and you saw me

863
00:59:37,744 --> 00:59:39,847
for the first time, just as you
might have seen Alijah.

864
00:59:40,180 --> 00:59:45,452
In the sensitivity training inevitably,
they know very little about the faith of Islam.

865
00:59:46,019 --> 00:59:52,092
They think that the faith of Islam is
a very maybe terroristic, militant, barbaric

866
00:59:52,092 --> 00:59:54,094
spread by the sword faith.

867
00:59:55,128 --> 00:59:58,866
And so when they have a Muslim
up there talking about

868
00:59:59,366 --> 01:00:03,837
patient rights, dignity,
issues around health

869
01:00:04,271 --> 01:00:08,709
and illness, all of a sudden you see
all of these stereotypes that people

870
01:00:09,009 --> 01:00:12,813
have as part of, you know, the baggage
as we grow up, just kind of fall.

871
01:00:12,913 --> 01:00:16,683
When you transcend culture,
you arrive at a universal place

872
01:00:16,884 --> 01:00:20,287
where our humanness is all the same.
You grieve the same.

873
01:00:21,121 --> 01:00:22,789
We all cry when someone we love dies.

874
01:00:23,457 --> 01:00:27,394
When we deliver, those of us who deliver,
we all experience labor.

875
01:00:28,328 --> 01:00:33,233
Something happened in Dearborn that further
established a need for this kind of work

876
01:00:33,500 --> 01:00:36,570
and that was a huge immigration process
as a result of the Gulf War.

877
01:00:37,337 --> 01:00:42,409
As a critical care nurse, Najah Bazzy
often has to counsel patients with terminal

878
01:00:42,409 --> 01:00:47,681
illnesses, like this Iraqi immigrant who
has just been diagnosed with uterine cancer.

879
01:00:49,383 --> 01:00:51,451
I said to her what do you think you have?

880
01:00:51,485 --> 01:00:55,856
And she said I have an infection in
the uterus and they took it out.

881
01:00:55,989 --> 01:00:59,760
Maybe she's not hearing it the first time,
maybe she doesn't need to hear it.

882
01:00:59,927 --> 01:01:01,261
Maybe she can't hear it.

883
01:01:01,628 --> 01:01:03,330
They're just not saying
the "C" word at all.

884
01:01:03,330 --> 01:01:05,332
They're not using that word with her.

885
01:01:05,499 --> 01:01:08,535
And they want to just
maintain hope, and uh...

886
01:01:08,569 --> 01:01:12,606
- just want to treat it
delicately, okay? - Okay. - Alright.

887
01:01:15,742 --> 01:01:17,110
Ok.. Thanks

888
01:01:17,444 --> 01:01:18,512
Salaam Alaykum

889
01:01:21,415 --> 01:01:24,751
These are families immigrating
from a way of life.

890
01:01:24,918 --> 01:01:27,154
And mostly because they
have been torn by war.

891
01:01:27,521 --> 01:01:33,260
And so they get here and
the helpers are here.

892
01:01:34,428 --> 01:01:37,130
And it's quite obligatory
to be that helper.

893
01:01:40,567 --> 01:01:44,137
When Muhammad arrived in Medina,
he made it clear that helping

894
01:01:44,137 --> 01:01:48,141
immigrants would be one of the
cornerstones of the new Islamic society.

895
01:01:49,209 --> 01:01:55,482
This is his message, spread peace,
feed people food, and

896
01:01:55,482 --> 01:01:59,820
do some devotional practice and you
will enter paradise without any trouble.

897
01:02:00,621 --> 01:02:05,359
Two-thirds of that message
is about other people.

898
01:02:05,592 --> 01:02:11,198
The secret of Medina is it's
a place where human beings are

899
01:02:11,198 --> 01:02:17,371
going to attempt to live up to
the ideal of the Islamic tradition.

900
01:02:18,505 --> 01:02:23,744
Part of the arrangement was that
the people of Medina agreed

901
01:02:23,744 --> 01:02:29,616
that they would provide housing and
support for the immigrants as they came in.

902
01:02:30,150 --> 01:02:32,853
And very often they were
even paired so that

903
01:02:33,253 --> 01:02:39,193
certain people had direct responsibility
for specific people from Mecca.

904
01:02:41,028 --> 01:02:43,163
And that did not take place in 24 hours.

905
01:02:43,597 --> 01:02:50,137
It came step by step, step by step, and
within a few months, you now had two groups

906
01:02:51,071 --> 01:02:54,541
the Helpers, so called,
El Ansar, that is, those

907
01:02:54,541 --> 01:03:00,047
Medinan Arabs who had become
Muslims, and the Meccans

908
01:03:00,047 --> 01:03:01,915
who had become Muslims before them.

909
01:03:02,382 --> 01:03:07,354
And in this way, for the first time, he created
the Islamic Ummah, that is, the Islamic people.

910
01:03:07,921 --> 01:03:11,558
That bond which transcends
all other bonds.

911
01:03:11,658 --> 01:03:14,461
He said to these people,
these are now your neighbors

912
01:03:14,561 --> 01:03:16,296
these are your brothers and sisters.

913
01:03:16,396 --> 01:03:19,633
He establishes that sense
of humanity, that Ummah.

914
01:03:19,900 --> 01:03:24,071
We are all connected to one another,
we are all responsible for one another.

915
01:03:24,972 --> 01:03:27,641
A couple of you guys
to carry to my car, ok?

916
01:03:28,509 --> 01:03:32,212
There's a mosque in
the heart of Detroit and

917
01:03:32,212 --> 01:03:34,848
it's run by an Imam who
started a soup kitchen

918
01:03:35,716 --> 01:03:39,887
I want the kids to be able to see
that that's part of Muhammad's message.

919
01:03:40,254 --> 01:03:44,024
- This is the exit right here.
- Hang on everybody it's a sharp turn.

920
01:03:45,325 --> 01:03:47,227
Hajji is like not a good driver.

921
01:03:47,594 --> 01:03:49,263
Listen, I'm a good driver.

922
01:03:49,263 --> 01:03:54,701
This is the first test. If you can't
pass this test the rest of it's off.

923
01:03:56,737 --> 01:03:59,339
The majority of the ones that come for
the soup kitchen are non-Muslim.

924
01:03:59,473 --> 01:04:03,844
It's only about, maybe one or two people
that are Muslim that come for the soup kitchen.

925
01:04:04,678 --> 01:04:10,717
And we let them know that it's a part
of who we are, as to why we're doing this.

926
01:04:10,984 --> 01:04:16,323
It's a part of what God has commanded for the
Muslims, for a human being to be charitable.

927
01:04:16,523 --> 01:04:20,828
I'm studying to be ordained as
a Catholic Deacon, so I had run into

928
01:04:20,828 --> 01:04:25,132
Abdullah when he made a presentation
about Islam and uh...

929
01:04:25,165 --> 01:04:28,902
I was really attracted
to the works of this mosque.

930
01:04:29,002 --> 01:04:33,240
I was never aware that there was
an active part of Muslim faith life

931
01:04:33,240 --> 01:04:37,911
that really reached out to the poor. I wasn't
even sure that it was part of your creed.

932
01:04:38,111 --> 01:04:42,149
Abdullah went through misunder standings
that would commonly exist...

933
01:04:42,216 --> 01:04:44,585
he started with the term Black Muslim.

934
01:04:45,152 --> 01:04:46,887
What does that bring to mind?

935
01:04:47,988 --> 01:04:52,726
And honestly it brought to mind certain
things that would make you fearful.

936
01:04:53,594 --> 01:04:58,599
Certain kinds of maybe aggressive
behavior, nationalistic kinds of thinking

937
01:04:58,599 --> 01:05:03,770
you know, as if we are going carve ourselves
off from the others and have no fellowship.

938
01:05:03,971 --> 01:05:10,210
He said if I tell you what the
stereotypes are that I have of Catholics

939
01:05:10,210 --> 01:05:13,380
when you listen to them,
you'll say oh those are

940
01:05:13,447 --> 01:05:17,050
extreme examples,
those are not what we are about.

941
01:05:24,124 --> 01:05:29,163
Dearborn is the place where
the early immigrants of

942
01:05:29,263 --> 01:05:33,400
Arab, Lebanese and Middle Eastern
people came and settled down.

943
01:05:34,568 --> 01:05:38,772
This country embraced them and
opened its door for them.

944
01:05:39,573 --> 01:05:44,745
Yet they needed time to adjust and
go through that

945
01:05:44,778 --> 01:05:48,315
difficulty they faced when
they came to this country.

946
01:05:49,349 --> 01:05:54,021
It's two different societies,
two different cultures.

947
01:05:58,392 --> 01:06:02,796
Najah and Ali Bazzy are raising
their family in the suburbs of Dearborn.

948
01:06:03,297 --> 01:06:06,733
Their children are third
generation American Muslims.

949
01:06:08,302 --> 01:06:10,804
We're trying to combine the best
of both worlds and giving

950
01:06:10,804 --> 01:06:13,407
our kids the family values that
our parents teach and realize

951
01:06:13,407 --> 01:06:15,976
that they live in, uh, you know,
a land in the United States

952
01:06:15,976 --> 01:06:18,846
which has, you know, many opportunities
for our kids to prosper in.

953
01:06:19,780 --> 01:06:21,515
- You still can't beat me.
- I'll beat you tonight.

954
01:06:21,849 --> 01:06:24,218
- Can you shoot five and 0?
- I can shoot 5 and 0 from anywhere.

955
01:06:24,218 --> 01:06:27,087
- 5 and 0 anywhere?
- Right now? Let's go.

956
01:06:27,321 --> 01:06:31,658
Like many Dearborn families the Bazzy's
struggle daily to balance the

957
01:06:31,725 --> 01:06:36,330
sometimes conflicting demands of their
faith and modern American society.

958
01:06:38,532 --> 01:06:41,969
Their daughter Nadia,
has decided to wear the hijab

959
01:06:41,969 --> 01:06:45,706
or head covering, that was first
worn by Muhammad's wives.

960
01:06:46,240 --> 01:06:50,744
Many Muslim women still wear the hijab
as a sign of modesty and piety.

961
01:06:51,578 --> 01:06:53,313
Well, we're gonna back you
one way or the other.

962
01:06:53,547 --> 01:06:54,715
That's a given.

963
01:06:56,350 --> 01:07:01,722
Our daughter came to us and said,
I made a decision.

964
01:07:02,022 --> 01:07:03,457
And she's 16 now.

965
01:07:03,824 --> 01:07:06,793
And she said, I've decided that
I want to wear hijab.

966
01:07:07,161 --> 01:07:09,930
The last time when you put it on, right?

967
01:07:09,930 --> 01:07:11,031
You made me take it off.

968
01:07:11,131 --> 01:07:12,199
No, I didn't make you take it off.

969
01:07:12,199 --> 01:07:16,303
I sort of persuade you thinking, try and bring
it out the other, end of the light of it, right?

970
01:07:16,503 --> 01:07:17,771
And you resented me for that, correct?

971
01:07:17,771 --> 01:07:18,839
Big time.

972
01:07:19,439 --> 01:07:21,775
I just thought maybe if you
go through high school

973
01:07:21,775 --> 01:07:24,711
and then put it on after
high school, that then

974
01:07:24,711 --> 01:07:27,214
if then, at least at that point
in life, you'll

975
01:07:27,214 --> 01:07:30,017
be able to see what you want
to do in life, and that.

976
01:07:30,017 --> 01:07:31,118
Because you gotta understand something.

977
01:07:31,118 --> 01:07:33,720
You know, you never know where you're
gonna be and where you're gonna go in life.

978
01:07:33,821 --> 01:07:35,989
I mean, it's, sure,
this hijab is accepted in

979
01:07:35,989 --> 01:07:38,525
our community here, and,
you know, you maybe do well.

980
01:07:38,525 --> 01:07:39,860
And you end up being a doctor or a lawyer

981
01:07:39,860 --> 01:07:41,662
whatever, you'll be doing
very well for yourself.

982
01:07:41,962 --> 01:07:44,331
But look what just happened to you
when you went down to Tennessee.

983
01:07:44,364 --> 01:07:46,300
I mean, here you have her driving a bus

984
01:07:46,300 --> 01:07:48,468
and the state police trooper
wants to stop over, we've

985
01:07:48,468 --> 01:07:50,671
got a whole bus full of people,
because he sees hijabs.

986
01:07:50,938 --> 01:07:54,875
I think for Nadia, he probably
feels much like I feel.

987
01:07:55,008 --> 01:07:58,212
There is great reverence for it,
and then there's that

988
01:07:58,212 --> 01:08:01,782
that oh my gosh, I want to protect
my daughter from the world.

989
01:08:01,949 --> 01:08:03,951
I don't want people to think
she's a terrorist.

990
01:08:03,951 --> 01:08:05,719
I don't want people
to think she's oppressed.

991
01:08:05,819 --> 01:08:09,256
I don't want people to think I'm her father,
I made her put that on her head.

992
01:08:09,623 --> 01:08:11,792
All of those kinds of things
come into play.

993
01:08:11,925 --> 01:08:14,895
I don't think Baba is, you know,
trying to hurt you here.

994
01:08:14,895 --> 01:08:17,331
He's trying to show you a picture
of the real world, and

995
01:08:17,331 --> 01:08:19,967
what you need to do is show him
a real picture of your world.

996
01:08:20,534 --> 01:08:23,070
He's a father, he has some
legitimate concerns.

997
01:08:23,770 --> 01:08:25,839
So my point is that you're
still the same Nadia.

998
01:08:26,139 --> 01:08:28,775
Ali, maybe she's not done
talking to you.

999
01:08:29,042 --> 01:08:30,544
You've talked to her.

1000
01:08:30,544 --> 01:08:32,779
Give her a few minutes and now
let her talk to you.

1001
01:08:33,547 --> 01:08:37,951
Do you know that I'm, that I'm doing
this for myself and for you?

1002
01:08:39,386 --> 01:08:43,290
Remember something. You're not doing it
for me. You're doing it for yourself and God.

1003
01:08:43,590 --> 01:08:44,658
All right?

1004
01:08:44,658 --> 01:08:46,326
You're the one who has to answer to God.

1005
01:08:46,393 --> 01:08:49,163
- So do you.
- I will answer to God. Don't worry about that.

1006
01:08:49,696 --> 01:08:53,800
I have my positives and my negatives in life
and I will answer to God, don't worry about it.

1007
01:08:53,901 --> 01:08:59,239
Baba, all that I do is a reflection of you.

1008
01:09:00,140 --> 01:09:03,710
You're in good shape, then.
You're in good shape, right?

1009
01:09:04,578 --> 01:09:06,013
So are we at peace?

1010
01:09:06,713 --> 01:09:08,348
I never knew we were at war

1011
01:09:35,776 --> 01:09:37,177
Muhammad also tells you that, you know

1012
01:09:37,211 --> 01:09:40,047
you should always give what's
best, uh, for your daughter.

1013
01:09:40,380 --> 01:09:43,917
And me as a father, I'm just trying
to give my daughter the opportunity.

1014
01:09:43,917 --> 01:09:47,588
To be able to see, uh, life from a wider
angle and a bigger perspective.

1015
01:09:51,859 --> 01:09:54,962
People would immigrate into different parts
of the country, but what was interesting is

1016
01:09:54,962 --> 01:09:59,066
that they would all manage to find their
way into Dearborn, a great many of them.

1017
01:10:01,034 --> 01:10:04,304
And the reason for that is because
the mosques were in place.

1018
01:10:07,241 --> 01:10:10,978
Dearborn's newest mosque will be
the largest in North America.

1019
01:10:11,578 --> 01:10:17,050
Like the first mosque in Medina, it is being
built with help from the entire community.

1020
01:10:19,920 --> 01:10:24,525
There's great feelings of ownership
to the mosque when the community builds it.

1021
01:10:27,461 --> 01:10:32,432
People are baking food.
Every year they contribute between

1022
01:10:32,533 --> 01:10:38,972
$50,000 to $100,000 to the income and
the operating costs of our mosque.

1023
01:10:39,773 --> 01:10:42,910
So, we have the building of this mosque,
kind of metaphorically

1024
01:10:43,110 --> 01:10:46,413
and the laying of the bricks and
this new foundation

1025
01:10:47,447 --> 01:10:49,817
with all these new immigrants in Dearborn.

1026
01:10:50,751 --> 01:10:53,020
And everybody brings their contribution.

1027
01:10:54,688 --> 01:10:58,192
Prophet Muhammad established
the first center in Medina

1028
01:10:58,559 --> 01:11:00,694
for Muslims and that was his mosque.

1029
01:11:01,028 --> 01:11:05,499
And it was not only a place where Muslims
go and do their prayer, or

1030
01:11:05,499 --> 01:11:09,970
offer their supplication, it was the center
for the entire community.

1031
01:11:09,970 --> 01:11:12,472
It was the headquarters of the Prophet.

1032
01:11:12,973 --> 01:11:19,313
He would become a judge and solve
problems among people inside the mosque.

1033
01:11:20,447 --> 01:11:25,786
So he receives delegations,
he would declare war or peace.

1034
01:11:26,820 --> 01:11:31,525
The mosque was serving multiple purposes
in the life of Prophet Muhammad.

1035
01:11:33,861 --> 01:11:36,430
It was at the mosque
that Muhammad discussed

1036
01:11:36,430 --> 01:11:38,966
a sweeping change in strategy
with his followers.

1037
01:11:39,399 --> 01:11:43,937
After years of exercising restraint
in the face of persecution by the Meccans

1038
01:11:44,104 --> 01:11:46,807
Muhammad received a clear new revelation

1039
01:11:46,807 --> 01:11:49,910
that marked a dramatic
departure from the past.

1040
01:11:50,143 --> 01:11:54,681
It gave the Muslims limited permission
to take up arms in self-defense.

1041
01:11:54,948 --> 01:11:58,418
The statesman was about
to become a general.

1042
01:12:00,320 --> 01:12:03,023
For 13 years, there's been no
sanction to fight.

1043
01:12:03,323 --> 01:12:05,459
Then a revelation comes that says

1044
01:12:06,160 --> 01:12:10,531
those who have been removed
unjustly from their homes, and

1045
01:12:10,631 --> 01:12:13,967
have been fought because
of their religious beliefs

1046
01:12:14,101 --> 01:12:16,270
are sanctioned to fight
to defend themselves.

1047
01:12:16,270 --> 01:12:21,208
Killing is always abhorrent,
the QURAN makes it very clear about that

1048
01:12:21,308 --> 01:12:27,848
and the QURAN says that it's always wrong
to start a war, to be an aggressor.

1049
01:12:28,081 --> 01:12:31,084
But persecution is worse than killing.

1050
01:12:31,185 --> 01:12:35,355
When people have been driven from their
homes, or deprived of their basic human rights

1051
01:12:35,389 --> 01:12:39,259
when an evil ideology comes
into the world, sometimes

1052
01:12:39,259 --> 01:12:43,831
regrettably, it may be necessary to fight
and sometimes lives will be lost.

1053
01:12:45,666 --> 01:12:50,737
Muhammad's first large military engagement
occurred near the town of Badr, when

1054
01:12:50,737 --> 01:12:56,810
313 Muslims set out to surprise a caravan
from Muhammad's own tribe, the Quraysh.

1055
01:12:58,245 --> 01:13:02,149
In a sense, the battle of Badr,
which became such a landmark

1056
01:13:02,382 --> 01:13:05,452
in Muslim history,
ah was a sort of mistake.

1057
01:13:05,953 --> 01:13:08,822
Ah, the Muslims had planned
a conventional raid but

1058
01:13:08,856 --> 01:13:13,594
the Meccans, when they heard
that this band of renegades

1059
01:13:13,627 --> 01:13:16,530
was attacking their great caravan

1060
01:13:16,530 --> 01:13:19,900
were so enraged they sent out
the whole army against them.

1061
01:13:20,200 --> 01:13:22,569
And the Muslims were convinced that
they were going to die.

1062
01:13:23,871 --> 01:13:25,806
He never wanted to fight the Meccans.

1063
01:13:25,839 --> 01:13:29,610
I mean, the Meccans are his people, uh,
his, his friends, his family.

1064
01:13:29,610 --> 01:13:34,848
He wants to co-opt them, he wants to make
them the key, if you will to the new

1065
01:13:34,848 --> 01:13:38,986
Islamic Ummah that he's trying to form,
so he doesn't want to go to war with them.

1066
01:13:40,487 --> 01:13:44,258
As he prepared to lead the Muslims
into battle, Muhammad took

1067
01:13:44,258 --> 01:13:48,495
the unprecedented step of establishing
clear rules of engagement for his army.

1068
01:13:49,630 --> 01:13:52,099
He makes it very clear to his soldiers

1069
01:13:52,199 --> 01:13:56,870
that if they have the right to use
force against the Qurayshy

1070
01:13:58,005 --> 01:14:02,309
that does not mean that they
will do the same thing

1071
01:14:02,342 --> 01:14:05,145
that has been done
in pre-Islamic wars.

1072
01:14:05,412 --> 01:14:07,414
In which women and children
could be killed

1073
01:14:07,414 --> 01:14:11,118
in which no prisoners could be taken,
no quarter given.

1074
01:14:11,118 --> 01:14:11,618
No, No.

1075
01:14:11,718 --> 01:14:14,888
He said Islam is a religion of law.

1076
01:14:17,791 --> 01:14:20,460
The Meccans had sent an army
of about 1,000 men.

1077
01:14:22,062 --> 01:14:25,732
As the army approached, Muhammad prepared
to make a stand near a well.

1078
01:14:27,100 --> 01:14:29,903
One of his soldiers suddenly
questioned his strategy

1079
01:14:30,504 --> 01:14:34,141
Has God revealed it to you? he asked,
"Or is it your own opinion?"

1080
01:14:35,209 --> 01:14:38,512
When Muhammad answered that he was
speaking as a man, not a prophet

1081
01:14:38,612 --> 01:14:41,582
the soldier suggested that they
stop at a larger well closer

1082
01:14:41,582 --> 01:14:44,051
to the enemy, so they could
deprive them of water.

1083
01:14:44,618 --> 01:14:46,353
Muhammad agreed at once.

1084
01:14:47,421 --> 01:14:52,359
The change in strategy proved decisive,
and the Muslims recorded a resounding triumph.

1085
01:14:57,831 --> 01:14:59,900
It was a victory that stunned the Muslims.

1086
01:15:01,034 --> 01:15:04,938
It seemed like a complete reversal,
like a miracle.

1087
01:15:05,138 --> 01:15:07,841
Almost a sort of revelation
of God in history.

1088
01:15:07,975 --> 01:15:09,776
A Furqan, they called it.

1089
01:15:09,910 --> 01:15:13,814
Something that separated
the just from the unjust.

1090
01:15:14,715 --> 01:15:20,053
After the battle, Muhammad received
a revelation claiming the victory for God.

1091
01:15:20,521 --> 01:15:24,024
The Muslims felt that angels
had been fighting alongside them.

1092
01:15:24,992 --> 01:15:28,595
The victory reaffirmed their
belief that God was on their side

1093
01:15:28,662 --> 01:15:31,532
and raised Muhammad's status higher still.

1094
01:15:32,766 --> 01:15:37,371
But his followers also knew that
the Meccans would seek violent retribution.

1095
01:15:38,038 --> 01:15:41,108
A year later, an army of 3,000 Meccans

1096
01:15:41,108 --> 01:15:45,312
returned to face 1,000 Muslims
in the battle of Uhud.

1097
01:15:45,479 --> 01:15:50,017
The resulting rout left the future
of Islam in mortal peril.

1098
01:15:51,051 --> 01:15:52,486
It was a horrible battle.

1099
01:15:52,753 --> 01:15:57,491
And the corpses of the Muslims were
mutilated by the Meccans.

1100
01:15:57,524 --> 01:15:59,660
And the Meccan women,
as was their wont

1101
01:15:59,693 --> 01:16:03,931
came out onto the battlefield and
danced around the corpses.

1102
01:16:06,633 --> 01:16:10,337
Sixty-five of Muhammad's soldiers
lost their lives in the battle

1103
01:16:10,604 --> 01:16:13,640
including a Rabbi who had
honored the Medina Pact

1104
01:16:13,841 --> 01:16:15,809
by fighting alongside Muhammad.

1105
01:16:16,910 --> 01:16:20,814
The families of the fallen Muslims
were now without protectors.

1106
01:16:21,482 --> 01:16:24,751
Then, Muhammad received a new revelation

1107
01:16:24,918 --> 01:16:28,322
allowing Muslim men to safeguard
these women and children

1108
01:16:28,455 --> 01:16:33,794
by taking as many as four wives, but
only if they could treat them equally.

1109
01:16:36,497 --> 01:16:39,900
That, in itself, in the context of Arabia,
was a bit of a restriction

1110
01:16:39,900 --> 01:16:43,570
because a man could have
unlimited number of wives

1111
01:16:43,904 --> 01:16:47,941
the context of the permission to polygamy

1112
01:16:48,041 --> 01:16:50,811
is to say who is going
to look after these women.

1113
01:16:50,811 --> 01:16:57,684
It was an act of faith, not an act
of lust that inspired men to take more wives.

1114
01:16:57,684 --> 01:17:01,421
So, it would be wrong to think
of the Prophet as basking

1115
01:17:01,421 --> 01:17:05,359
decadently in the garden of sensual
delights with his harem.

1116
01:17:05,359 --> 01:17:08,795
His harem was very much a matter of state

1117
01:17:08,862 --> 01:17:12,065
and sometimes his wives were
rather a mixed blessing.

1118
01:17:12,833 --> 01:17:17,304
Although Muhammad was monogamous
during Khadija's life, after her death

1119
01:17:17,604 --> 01:17:19,773
he eventually married a number of women

1120
01:17:19,940 --> 01:17:23,177
including one of the Uhud widows,
Umm Salama.

1121
01:17:24,678 --> 01:17:27,915
The reason for his marriages
were really political alliances.

1122
01:17:28,081 --> 01:17:32,419
It was a tribal society, and for Muhammad
to marry into another tribe and

1123
01:17:32,486 --> 01:17:36,290
take a wife just meant that there was
a bond being created with this tribe.

1124
01:17:37,291 --> 01:17:41,228
Among Muhammad's wives were the daughters
of his two closest allies

1125
01:17:41,662 --> 01:17:43,430
Abu Bakr and Umar.

1126
01:17:44,698 --> 01:17:46,967
Abu Bakr's daughter, Aisha, would become

1127
01:17:46,967 --> 01:17:49,269
one of the most influential
women in his life.

1128
01:17:50,304 --> 01:17:54,608
Aisha was very lively.
She was, uh, brilliant.

1129
01:17:55,075 --> 01:17:57,277
She was somebody that questioned the prophet.

1130
01:17:57,277 --> 01:18:02,149
She was not somebody in any way that
um took everything, she questioned him.

1131
01:18:02,149 --> 01:18:04,151
She said, what does that mean?

1132
01:18:04,451 --> 01:18:06,653
Uh, why did you do this,
why did you do that?

1133
01:18:06,920 --> 01:18:10,624
Um, she was somebody that really had a,
an incredibly active mind.

1134
01:18:10,624 --> 01:18:15,629
She memorized vast amounts of prophetic
traditions, and she's considered to be

1135
01:18:15,629 --> 01:18:18,398
actually, the transmitter of a large number

1136
01:18:18,398 --> 01:18:21,268
of, uh, traditions from the prophet Muhammad.

1137
01:18:24,605 --> 01:18:29,443
In the year that followed the battle
of Uhud, the Meccans girded themselves

1138
01:18:29,443 --> 01:18:34,681
for a final assault that they hoped would
finish off the Muslims once and for all.

1139
01:18:35,349 --> 01:18:37,618
They assembled one of the largest armies

1140
01:18:37,618 --> 01:18:40,921
ever seen in Arabia and marched on Medina.

1141
01:18:41,321 --> 01:18:44,091
But Muhammad hit upon a daring defense.

1142
01:18:45,459 --> 01:18:50,597
Muhammad has dug a trench around
the whole of the settlement.

1143
01:18:50,998 --> 01:18:56,036
And you have an almost comic scene
with the Meccan cavalry

1144
01:18:56,036 --> 01:19:01,241
galloping up to this trench, and pulling back
in horror, and saying what is this?

1145
01:19:01,241 --> 01:19:04,111
They've never seen anything so
unsporting in their lives.

1146
01:19:04,244 --> 01:19:06,780
This is something, they say,
the Arabs don't do.

1147
01:19:07,281 --> 01:19:11,618
It sounds comical but surrounded
by the powerful Meccan army

1148
01:19:12,019 --> 01:19:16,223
the Muslims were expecting all
to be killed, to a man, to a woman.

1149
01:19:17,457 --> 01:19:21,695
Stopped by the trench around Medina,
the Meccans laid siege

1150
01:19:21,728 --> 01:19:25,232
to the city and to the hundreds
of Muslim families trapped inside.

1151
01:19:25,833 --> 01:19:28,569
According to the Muslim sources,
in their determination

1152
01:19:28,569 --> 01:19:31,572
to defeat Muhammad,
the Meccans had recruited

1153
01:19:31,638 --> 01:19:34,141
as allies many Bedouin tribes

1154
01:19:34,274 --> 01:19:38,812
as well as the largest Jewish tribe
within Medina, the Bani Qurayzah.

1155
01:19:39,513 --> 01:19:42,683
For the Muslims,
this defection was the final blow

1156
01:19:42,683 --> 01:19:46,053
in a relationship that had been
strained from the beginning.

1157
01:19:47,321 --> 01:19:49,356
When Muhammad came to town

1158
01:19:49,890 --> 01:19:52,693
the organized Jewish community
did not accept his prophecy.

1159
01:19:53,193 --> 01:19:55,362
There were, according
to the Islamic sources

1160
01:19:55,429 --> 01:19:57,531
some individual Jews that did accept him

1161
01:19:57,764 --> 01:20:00,234
but for the most part the community
as a whole did not.

1162
01:20:01,001 --> 01:20:03,370
If the Jews would accept his
Prophethood, then he has

1163
01:20:03,370 --> 01:20:05,772
tremendous and complete
confirmation of his Prophethood.

1164
01:20:06,273 --> 01:20:10,410
But the Jews were so well respected that
when they rejected his prophethood

1165
01:20:10,444 --> 01:20:11,979
and they did it actively

1166
01:20:12,146 --> 01:20:16,850
they became a very serious political
threat to his very existence in Medina.

1167
01:20:18,785 --> 01:20:20,921
Despite the aid of the Bani Qurayzah

1168
01:20:21,121 --> 01:20:24,258
the Meccan siege could not break
through the Muslim defenses.

1169
01:20:24,892 --> 01:20:26,160
When the weather turned bad

1170
01:20:26,193 --> 01:20:29,329
and as the Bedouin tribes began
deserting the field of battle

1171
01:20:29,663 --> 01:20:32,533
the Meccans themselves
lost heart and departed

1172
01:20:32,799 --> 01:20:38,372
abandoning their Jewish allies to be
tried by the Muslims for the crime of treason.

1173
01:20:39,039 --> 01:20:42,309
Islamic sources believe that
the Jews did indeed

1174
01:20:42,676 --> 01:20:45,479
aid the enemy in trying
to defeat Muhammad.

1175
01:20:45,813 --> 01:20:49,783
This was absolutely against
the terms of the Media agreement.

1176
01:20:50,150 --> 01:20:53,987
The Jews and the Muslims decided
that they would choose

1177
01:20:54,121 --> 01:20:56,990
an arbitrator to determine what would
be the future of the Jews.

1178
01:20:57,758 --> 01:21:00,394
The person who was chosen was a man

1179
01:21:00,394 --> 01:21:03,096
who was mortally wounded
in the Battle of the Trench.

1180
01:21:03,630 --> 01:21:07,568
And so he determined that the women and
children of the Bani Qurayzah

1181
01:21:07,568 --> 01:21:11,872
would be taken as slaves to the Muslims,
and the men would be killed.

1182
01:21:12,339 --> 01:21:14,141
The Prophet agreed with this judgement.

1183
01:21:14,408 --> 01:21:16,009
When he judged he said

1184
01:21:16,510 --> 01:21:19,580
that you have judged according
to God and his messenger.

1185
01:21:19,847 --> 01:21:23,884
And then, uh, approximately 700 men

1186
01:21:24,351 --> 01:21:27,321
uh, were killed. Uh, they were executed.

1187
01:21:27,821 --> 01:21:30,691
So, this definitely occurred.

1188
01:21:31,625 --> 01:21:38,732
All that can be said is that,
this cannot be seen as anti-Semitism, per se.

1189
01:21:38,732 --> 01:21:45,072
MUHAMMAD had nothing against the Jewish
people per se, or the Jewish religion.

1190
01:21:45,239 --> 01:21:49,877
The QURAN continues to tell Muslims
to honor the People of the Book.

1191
01:21:50,210 --> 01:21:53,981
And to honor their religion as authentic.

1192
01:21:54,481 --> 01:21:57,818
And the Jewish tribes who had not rebelled

1193
01:21:58,418 --> 01:22:00,454
who had not given help to the MECCANS

1194
01:22:00,521 --> 01:22:03,924
continued to live in MEDINA,
completely unmolested.

1195
01:22:04,158 --> 01:22:06,760
MUHAMMAD was not trying to exterminate Jews.

1196
01:22:06,760 --> 01:22:10,397
He was trying to get rid of very
dangerous internal enemies.

1197
01:22:11,031 --> 01:22:15,869
It's unfortunate that many historians and
particularly in contemporary times

1198
01:22:15,869 --> 01:22:19,940
both on the Jewish and on the Muslim
side, uh, have transformed this.

1199
01:22:20,207 --> 01:22:23,544
On the Jewish side, they have
used that as a way of saying

1200
01:22:23,544 --> 01:22:26,113
well, you see, the Muslims hate
the Jews and they kill them.

1201
01:22:26,280 --> 01:22:28,315
And, and on the Muslim side, it says

1202
01:22:28,315 --> 01:22:31,585
well, you see, the Jews are full of
treachery and can't be trusted.

1203
01:22:31,985 --> 01:22:33,020
Both are wrong.

1204
01:22:35,656 --> 01:22:41,695
When the other tribes of the peninsula
saw the impotence of Mecca

1205
01:22:41,995 --> 01:22:45,766
with all its power and might
against this little community

1206
01:22:46,200 --> 01:22:50,270
they began to switch allegiance and
see that Muhammad was the coming man.

1207
01:22:51,004 --> 01:22:53,674
Now once that happened,
once the tide had been turned

1208
01:22:53,674 --> 01:22:55,909
after the battle of the trench, and

1209
01:22:55,909 --> 01:23:00,647
the Muslims were no longer subject
to the fear of extermination

1210
01:23:00,747 --> 01:23:02,749
Muhammad stopped the fighting.

1211
01:23:03,750 --> 01:23:07,554
The Prophet Muhammad
received a few people

1212
01:23:07,554 --> 01:23:11,058
militants who just arrived
from one of the battles that

1213
01:23:11,058 --> 01:23:14,862
they came back from and,
they felt so important that

1214
01:23:14,895 --> 01:23:18,565
we finished this job fighting
with the enemies of Islam.

1215
01:23:19,099 --> 01:23:22,936
And the Prophet smiled and he said
let me tell you something.

1216
01:23:22,936 --> 01:23:27,608
You finished the minor Jihad and now
you have the bigger Jihad ahead of you.

1217
01:23:27,941 --> 01:23:29,476
And they were stunned.

1218
01:23:29,510 --> 01:23:32,012
They thought that they just
finished the biggest achievement

1219
01:23:32,045 --> 01:23:35,582
in their life by being willing
to sacrifice their own life.

1220
01:23:36,016 --> 01:23:40,287
And the Prophet explained
that the biggest Jihad

1221
01:23:40,354 --> 01:23:45,225
is struggle against your own
desires and limitations.

1222
01:23:47,961 --> 01:23:52,499
Jihad does not mean holy war, primarily.

1223
01:23:52,866 --> 01:23:55,702
The word means effort, striving.

1224
01:23:56,170 --> 01:24:03,343
And it's always a hard struggle to put
the word of God into practice.

1225
01:24:03,544 --> 01:24:06,146
When the Quran talks about struggling or

1226
01:24:06,213 --> 01:24:09,550
they're not talking always
about fighting a holy war

1227
01:24:09,550 --> 01:24:12,152
they're talking about this immense
struggle to implement

1228
01:24:12,219 --> 01:24:16,690
a divine imperative in the flawed and
tragic conditions of daily life.

1229
01:24:16,990 --> 01:24:20,694
Fighting might sometimes have
to be done as part of the Jihad

1230
01:24:20,694 --> 01:24:23,530
but it is by no means the major imperative.

1231
01:24:25,165 --> 01:24:30,838
I remember a quotation from Jesus,
peace be upon him(PBUH)

1232
01:24:31,305 --> 01:24:36,276
who says that the first
step in the reformation

1233
01:24:36,276 --> 01:24:39,480
journey is to start with your own self.

1234
01:24:39,680 --> 01:24:44,551
If you want to reform the society
you have to reform yourself first.

1235
01:24:44,852 --> 01:24:47,654
And that was basically the meaning of Jihad.

1236
01:24:54,761 --> 01:24:58,532
The Prophet put that emphasis
on inner development.

1237
01:24:58,532 --> 01:25:06,306
Jihad, the constant struggle with yourself,
to improve yourself and perfect your intent.

1238
01:25:06,540 --> 01:25:09,076
That you do things only for the sake of God.

1239
01:25:09,610 --> 01:25:16,450
The most excellent Jihad, Holy struggle,
is the struggle to control your ego, the self.

1240
01:25:21,221 --> 01:25:26,727
For a long time I was deathly afraid
of speaking in public, of giving speeches.

1241
01:25:27,461 --> 01:25:31,632
And I saw that and I, well, this my Jihad,
I've gotta overcome this fear.

1242
01:25:31,632 --> 01:25:35,169
If I'm gonna help people, it's gonna be
necessary for me to talk in public.

1243
01:25:35,569 --> 01:25:36,937
To be able just to speak out.

1244
01:25:38,472 --> 01:25:42,309
And going back to 1987 I had
become active as far as writing

1245
01:25:42,376 --> 01:25:47,214
articles for papers to have
fire safe cigarette legislation enacted.

1246
01:25:47,381 --> 01:25:50,250
Cigarettes are the largest cause
of fire fatalities in the nation.

1247
01:25:51,919 --> 01:25:56,023
So, I began writing and because
of my position I could speak from

1248
01:25:56,023 --> 01:26:00,561
the authority as a fire fighter and,
and now a Supervising Fire Marshal.

1249
01:26:02,262 --> 01:26:05,966
Going back to if you save one life
it's like you saved all humanity.

1250
01:26:05,966 --> 01:26:07,668
Well I feel I was part of an effort

1251
01:26:08,435 --> 01:26:11,305
to save thousands of lives each year because

1252
01:26:11,305 --> 01:26:14,308
of this legislation that
we passed in New York State.

1253
01:26:19,980 --> 01:26:21,615
Jihad is misused.

1254
01:26:21,882 --> 01:26:27,221
There is absolutely nothing in Islam
that justifies, uh, the claim of

1255
01:26:27,221 --> 01:26:33,360
Osama bin Laden, Al Qaeda or other
similar groups to kill innocent civilians.

1256
01:26:34,228 --> 01:26:37,898
That is unequivocally a crime
under Islamic law.

1257
01:26:38,999 --> 01:26:43,170
Acts of terror violence that have
occurred in the name of Islam

1258
01:26:43,470 --> 01:26:46,773
are not only wrong,
they are contrary to Islam.

1259
01:26:50,177 --> 01:26:53,680
September 11th, I hooked up with
two other fire marshals.

1260
01:26:54,181 --> 01:26:58,919
We found a place to park near the bridge,
about several inches of soot.

1261
01:26:59,186 --> 01:27:02,656
If it had been white and colder out,
you would have sworn it was snow.

1262
01:27:04,525 --> 01:27:10,364
We came over the Brooklyn Bridge, uh
it was just like something out of a movie.

1263
01:27:11,265 --> 01:27:14,801
It was very quiet, you know, that muffled
sound that you have during a blizzard

1264
01:27:14,835 --> 01:27:17,638
you know, where you can't hear your feet
hitting the ground, it's just very muffled

1265
01:27:17,638 --> 01:27:19,006
very quiet.

1266
01:27:19,373 --> 01:27:22,709
So we put on our turn out gear and
we started heading over there.

1267
01:27:22,809 --> 01:27:27,614
And it's just, I think
I could speak for all of

1268
01:27:27,614 --> 01:27:30,484
we were just all in a state
of shock and disbelief.

1269
01:27:32,219 --> 01:27:37,958
I just felt, oh, in the back of my head,
please don't be Muslims doing this.

1270
01:27:39,359 --> 01:27:43,230
And I just felt ah, I just felt sick.

1271
01:27:52,039 --> 01:27:56,210
We could see this fragment of the

1272
01:27:56,743 --> 01:27:59,980
World Trade Center sticking up
almost like a lopsided crown.

1273
01:28:00,981 --> 01:28:03,517
Then we started walking
down one way and

1274
01:28:04,585 --> 01:28:07,621
we saw some fire fighters, you know

1275
01:28:07,621 --> 01:28:09,790
dazed and shell shocked,
saying don't go down there

1276
01:28:09,790 --> 01:28:11,925
there's still more collapses happening.

1277
01:28:13,193 --> 01:28:15,395
I mean, we were dying to go
out there and do something.

1278
01:28:16,897 --> 01:28:19,900
And, you know, we're figuring that
some of the brothers or even

1279
01:28:20,100 --> 01:28:23,136
anyone, you know, people could still
be alive, trapped under the rubble.

1280
01:28:24,071 --> 01:28:28,008
But, we just, it was frustrating,
but, I mean

1281
01:28:28,008 --> 01:28:30,010
you have to understand that
they don't want to lose more people

1282
01:28:30,010 --> 01:28:32,112
on top of the people who are lost already.

1283
01:28:35,149 --> 01:28:38,218
This is just, I mean, it was just out and
out madness what they did.

1284
01:28:38,619 --> 01:28:43,023
The Prophet himself in the course
of the circumstances engaged in battle

1285
01:28:43,090 --> 01:28:47,194
in warfare, but he had a certain code
of conduct that he followed.

1286
01:28:47,628 --> 01:28:53,967
So, you have to separate fanaticism,
which every religion has

1287
01:28:54,301 --> 01:28:57,037
from the reality and the truth
of that religion.

1288
01:28:57,437 --> 01:28:59,473
These are fanatics who have lost

1289
01:29:00,007 --> 01:29:05,179
sight of what the purpose of religion is and
they're acting, you know, on their own.

1290
01:29:09,616 --> 01:29:16,824
What hurt me probably most of all,
out of the World Trade Center attack

1291
01:29:18,425 --> 01:29:23,764
was that here is a religion that
I entered because of the universality.

1292
01:29:23,864 --> 01:29:27,234
And the tolerance that
is throughout the book and

1293
01:29:27,234 --> 01:29:29,069
throughout the sayings of Prophet Muhammad.

1294
01:29:30,470 --> 01:29:34,241
Yet, these people who did that and
were behind it and planned it

1295
01:29:35,008 --> 01:29:38,178
were just so intolerant and

1296
01:29:38,946 --> 01:29:42,249
so disregarding of their own tenets

1297
01:29:42,249 --> 01:29:45,552
that they could do something so horrific and
kill people in such a horrible

1298
01:29:45,552 --> 01:29:49,323
***Missing***

1299
01:29:49,890 --> 01:29:51,959

01:30:11,812 --> 01:30:15,849
***Missing***

1305
01:30:23,690 --> 01:30:27,161
September 11th,
underscored the need to have dialogue

1306
01:30:27,261 --> 01:30:29,596
with non-Muslims and other faiths

1307
01:30:30,063 --> 01:30:35,836
to understand each other and to try to resolve
these hot spots that fester and cause

1308
01:30:36,303 --> 01:30:37,905
this type of hatred.

1309
01:30:40,374 --> 01:30:42,876
Uh, the death and destruction
in New York City

1310
01:30:43,343 --> 01:30:48,248
that was caused by this terrible,
terrible act in the name of Islam

1311
01:30:48,582 --> 01:30:53,253
has propelled the Muslim community in
New York to respond in many different ways.

1312
01:30:53,253 --> 01:30:55,455
And one of the ways that I want to respond

1313
01:30:55,455 --> 01:30:57,724
is the way the Prophet would have responded.

1314
01:30:58,292 --> 01:31:03,263
To just talk about the humanity
which we all belong to.

1315
01:31:04,731 --> 01:31:08,669
Since September 11 Muslims
have gone to churches

1316
01:31:09,069 --> 01:31:13,006
to synagogues,
to schools to explain our faith.

1317
01:31:13,407 --> 01:31:15,742
However, people still kept asking

1318
01:31:16,443 --> 01:31:20,514
where are the Muslims and why aren't
they doing something about it.

1319
01:31:21,515 --> 01:31:26,153
So I started thinking about this and I said,
what is it that we are not doing right?

1320
01:31:27,120 --> 01:31:30,023
Maybe we need to respond
in a more gentle way.

1321
01:31:31,325 --> 01:31:35,229
So I looked around for the mildest
people in our community.

1322
01:31:35,529 --> 01:31:37,130
The artists in our community.

1323
01:31:38,065 --> 01:31:40,701
And the first person
I called was Mohamed Zakariya.

1324
01:31:41,668 --> 01:31:46,740
Catastrophes have brought us here,
but not all is lost.

1325
01:31:46,840 --> 01:31:50,310
Uh, through our art,
we pick up all these broken pieces and

1326
01:31:50,310 --> 01:31:53,580
try to put them back together again and
make something that's gonna work.

1327
01:31:54,648 --> 01:31:59,953
Revenge, suicide bombing, things of that
kind they have no place in Islam.

1328
01:32:00,020 --> 01:32:02,289
They must never have
a place in Islam, never.

1329
01:32:02,856 --> 01:32:03,924
Never.

1330
01:32:04,458 --> 01:32:07,294
Islam is really a soft thing,
it's not a hard thing

1331
01:32:08,228 --> 01:32:12,733
And so we have to approach it with
softness, and be soft to each other.

1332
01:32:13,467 --> 01:32:15,369
(Arabic) the Prophet said.

1333
01:32:15,369 --> 01:32:17,070
Make it easy and not difficult.

1334
01:32:18,272 --> 01:32:20,707
So we should put away
all those angry words

1335
01:32:21,308 --> 01:32:23,610
the harsh, the strident rhetoric that

1336
01:32:23,610 --> 01:32:27,181
that we have been dealing with
for all these years that we've suffered

1337
01:32:27,181 --> 01:32:30,050
through this sweet religion
with this beastly stuff.

1338
01:32:30,684 --> 01:32:33,220
And come out into the light,
and be bright.

1339
01:32:33,921 --> 01:32:35,222
Be bright in America.

1340
01:32:35,956 --> 01:32:39,259
And look in the mirror,
that's what we have to do.

1341
01:32:39,693 --> 01:32:41,128
Salaam Alaykum

1342
01:32:45,465 --> 01:32:47,935
This piece is the golden rule of Islam.

1343
01:32:48,235 --> 01:32:52,139
It is the basis of the relations
between people

1344
01:32:52,840 --> 01:32:55,876
It means that there is no harming
of other people in Islam

1345
01:32:55,876 --> 01:32:58,679
and no returning or retaliating
harm for harm.

1346
01:32:59,379 --> 01:33:00,881
And so that's why I did it.

1347
01:33:01,148 --> 01:33:04,451
To respond through the sayings
of Muhammad the man.

1348
01:33:10,324 --> 01:33:13,894
By the year 628,
the battles that had occupied

1349
01:33:13,894 --> 01:33:17,865
the Muslims for the preceding
four years had come to an end.

1350
01:33:20,567 --> 01:33:26,173
Once the Muslims were no longer fearing
the threat of total extermination

1351
01:33:26,406 --> 01:33:30,944
MUHAMMAD knew that the time
for fighting had stopped.

1352
01:33:31,245 --> 01:33:35,616
And it was now time to make
an extraordinary initiantive

1353
01:33:36,083 --> 01:33:38,719
a peaceful, nonviolent initiative.

1354
01:33:40,921 --> 01:33:44,124
He astonished the whole Muslim community

1355
01:33:44,124 --> 01:33:46,827
and the whole community
of Yathrib by announcing that

1356
01:33:46,827 --> 01:33:50,030
he was going to go on the Hajj pilgrimage

1357
01:33:50,764 --> 01:33:54,868
Dangerous as it was,
an enormously risky as it was

1358
01:33:54,868 --> 01:33:59,740
about a thousand Muslims
volunteered to go with MUHAMMAD.

1359
01:34:01,975 --> 01:34:04,912
All the rites were fulfilled to the letter.

1360
01:34:05,479 --> 01:34:09,650
The camels all decked in
their special sacrificial garments.

1361
01:34:10,651 --> 01:34:13,954
The men all in their white garb.

1362
01:34:14,688 --> 01:34:18,125
The Muslims set out
on the perilous trip to Mecca

1363
01:34:18,125 --> 01:34:22,429
crossing the vast desert without
any arms to defend themselves.

1364
01:34:22,963 --> 01:34:27,100
When they reached Hudaybiyah,
just outside the sacred area around Mecca

1365
01:34:27,100 --> 01:34:29,069
where violence was forbidden

1366
01:34:29,369 --> 01:34:35,742
Muhammad surprised his followers not
to enter, but to sit and wait.

1367
01:34:36,777 --> 01:34:41,715
He then sent an emissary to Mecca seeking
permission to complete the pilgrimage.

1368
01:34:42,015 --> 01:34:45,052
MUHAMMAD knew of course,
that he was putting the

1369
01:34:45,052 --> 01:34:48,188
people of MECCA into a really
impossible position.

1370
01:34:48,489 --> 01:34:55,729
Because if they forbade Arabs, to enter
the city and perform the rights of the Ka'aba

1371
01:34:55,896 --> 01:35:01,168
they would be abusing their position
as guardians of the holy places.

1372
01:35:01,768 --> 01:35:04,671
The MECCANS themselves did not
know what to do.

1373
01:35:07,040 --> 01:35:11,612
When the emissary did not return quickly,
the Muslims feared the worst.

1374
01:35:12,112 --> 01:35:14,381
But Muhammad's gambit paid off.

1375
01:35:14,681 --> 01:35:17,151
The Meccans offered to negotiate a treaty.

1376
01:35:17,751 --> 01:35:19,520
With tensions running high

1377
01:35:19,753 --> 01:35:24,091
Muhammad began dictating its first
line by stating his own name.

1378
01:35:25,559 --> 01:35:31,098
Ali was taking down the notes
with the MECCAN negotiator at his side

1379
01:35:31,098 --> 01:35:33,467
and when MUHAMMAD began to saying

1380
01:35:33,467 --> 01:35:36,870
the Prophet of God, the MECCAN saids,
I don't believe you are the Prophet of God

1381
01:35:37,337 --> 01:35:38,872
I can't sign to that.

1382
01:35:39,206 --> 01:35:43,043
So he said fine, Muhammad,
Son Of Abdullah.

1383
01:35:43,745 --> 01:35:47,581
And many of the Muslims felt that
this was a major insult.

1384
01:35:47,714 --> 01:35:53,387
The Muslims, sitting around Hudaybiyah
watched this in utter dismay.

1385
01:35:54,488 --> 01:35:56,723
There was almost a mutiny.

1386
01:35:56,890 --> 01:36:01,628
A thousand pilgrims stood,
refusing to accept this.

1387
01:36:03,330 --> 01:36:08,936
MUHAMMAD went back into his tent
where he had his wife, Umm Salama.

1388
01:36:09,102 --> 01:36:11,205
And he said to her, what shall I do?

1389
01:36:11,805 --> 01:36:14,074
And she gave him some excellent advice

1390
01:36:15,442 --> 01:36:20,147
part of the ritual of the HAJJ
was that you sacrificed a camel.

1391
01:36:20,581 --> 01:36:23,884
And he went out and
he sacrificed one of the camels

1392
01:36:23,884 --> 01:36:27,488
and somehow some kind of necessary
tension was released.

1393
01:36:31,592 --> 01:36:36,530
The ritual sacrifice of an animal
traditionally marked the end of the pilgrimage.

1394
01:36:37,264 --> 01:36:40,968
Grudgingly, the Muslims considered
the pilgrimage complete

1395
01:36:41,101 --> 01:36:42,669
and headed back to Medina.

1396
01:36:43,437 --> 01:36:47,641
Muhammad had compromised on every
major point in the treaty.

1397
01:36:47,941 --> 01:36:51,044
But he had won the most
significant concession.

1398
01:36:51,645 --> 01:36:55,249
In return for postponing their
entry into Mecca for a year

1399
01:36:55,849 --> 01:36:58,852
the Muslims had secured
ten years of peace

1400
01:36:59,119 --> 01:37:02,189
and official recognition
as a political entity.

1401
01:37:02,856 --> 01:37:07,995
Muhammad had proved himself as capable
a diplomat as he was a religious leader.

1402
01:37:10,664 --> 01:37:12,699
There was wisdom in the treaty

1403
01:37:13,200 --> 01:37:15,869
because one of the things that
was promised to the Muslims

1404
01:37:16,870 --> 01:37:20,073
was protection as they moved
throughout Arabia.

1405
01:37:20,374 --> 01:37:22,242
That they would not be harmed and
they could move freely.

1406
01:37:23,677 --> 01:37:29,249
And what was gained most greatly from that
was the dauwa, the teaching of al-Islam.

1407
01:37:30,818 --> 01:37:35,322
On the way back to Medina,
Muhammad told a companion, Umar

1408
01:37:35,322 --> 01:37:40,561
I have received a revelation which is dearer
to me than anything else beneath the sun.

1409
01:37:41,195 --> 01:37:45,599
it said, "Surely",
"We have given you a clear victory. "

1410
01:37:47,067 --> 01:37:50,737
Then more and more and more
people came to Islam

1411
01:37:50,771 --> 01:37:52,673
more and more people turned to MUHAMMAD.

1412
01:37:52,673 --> 01:37:55,475
It sent out a huge signal of strength.

1413
01:37:55,475 --> 01:38:02,115
Strength of purpose, utter courage, utter
panache, and utter wisdom that, of course

1414
01:38:02,115 --> 01:38:03,150
you could go on to fight

1415
01:38:03,250 --> 01:38:06,587
of course he could have gone on being
the prophet with the sword

1416
01:38:06,653 --> 01:38:10,958
but there are times when
to make peace is more daring

1417
01:38:11,158 --> 01:38:13,327
more creative, and more enduring.

1418
01:38:16,730 --> 01:38:20,000
One year after signing
the Hudaybiyah treaty,

1419
01:38:20,200 --> 01:38:23,971
Muhammad led his followers on
a new pilgrimage to Mecca.

1420
01:38:25,239 --> 01:38:29,476
After years of rejection,
persecution, and humiliation

1421
01:38:29,877 --> 01:38:32,946
this was truly a moment of triumph.

1422
01:38:34,681 --> 01:38:38,152
The first pilgrimage of the Muslims

1423
01:38:38,152 --> 01:38:43,357
after Hudaybiyah must have been
an extraordinary event for everybody.

1424
01:38:43,824 --> 01:38:45,692
Because the MECCANS couldn't bear it.

1425
01:38:46,193 --> 01:38:50,998
They decamped and went and sat up in
the hills and mountains outside the city, and

1426
01:38:50,998 --> 01:38:57,371
watched this procession, huge procession
of Muslims, and some of their confederates

1427
01:38:57,538 --> 01:39:02,142
coming on the HAJJ, and as it were,
taking possession of the city

1428
01:39:02,142 --> 01:39:07,314
crying out the pilgrim cry, here I am, oh,
God, here I come, in a huge cry.

1429
01:39:07,981 --> 01:39:12,319
Then came the moment Muhammad had waited
seven long years to achieve.

1430
01:39:12,953 --> 01:39:15,722
Muhammad sends Bilal, an African ex-slave

1431
01:39:16,223 --> 01:39:18,895
this lowest of the low
in the eyes of the Meccans

1432
01:39:18,900 --> 01:39:21,895
up on to the sacred shrine of the Ka'aba

1433
01:39:22,996 --> 01:39:25,599
what the Meccans regard as their shrine

1434
01:39:27,301 --> 01:39:28,936
to deliver the call to prayer.

1435
01:39:30,404 --> 01:39:32,673
And the hills around Mecca are granite.

1436
01:39:32,873 --> 01:39:35,242
They're set up for a sonorous voice.

1437
01:39:35,976 --> 01:39:39,713
And the call to prayer resonates
through the valley.

1438
01:40:28,395 --> 01:40:35,502
Bilal was proclaiming for all to hear,
there is one God and Muhammad is his Prophet.

1439
01:40:37,704 --> 01:40:41,542
It must have been an appalling moment
for the MECCANS.

1440
01:40:41,842 --> 01:40:45,879
But an extraordinary moment
of exhilaration for the Muslims.

1441
01:40:46,213 --> 01:40:48,649
Performing all the rites punctiliously

1442
01:40:48,782 --> 01:40:53,687
and then taking no advantage of this,
going back peacefully home.

1443
01:40:58,058 --> 01:41:01,929
But the peace between the Muslims and
the people of Mecca would not last.

1444
01:41:02,262 --> 01:41:06,133
By the end of the year, the Meccans
had broken the Treaty of Hudaybiyah

1445
01:41:06,400 --> 01:41:09,469
by attacking a clan allied with Muhammad.

1446
01:41:10,003 --> 01:41:13,774
In response, 10 days into
the holy month of Ramadan

1447
01:41:14,041 --> 01:41:20,013
Muhammad and a Muslim army of 10,000 men
set out to take Mecca by force.

1448
01:41:21,248 --> 01:41:24,985
The Prophet felt he was strong enough
to be able to conquer MECCA.

1449
01:41:26,653 --> 01:41:31,725
But as the army approached the city,
more and more leaders of the Quraysh

1450
01:41:32,092 --> 01:41:38,499
realized that they were not going to win,
and so many decided to join Islam.

1451
01:41:41,502 --> 01:41:44,571
The prophet entered the city
without resistance.

1452
01:41:45,239 --> 01:41:48,041
When he came into Mecca he came
in with his head bowed down.

1453
01:41:48,175 --> 01:41:52,880
He did not come in as, as,
as an arrogant conquering warrior.

1454
01:41:52,980 --> 01:41:57,351
He comes in humbled by a victory
that he sees is from God.

1455
01:41:58,452 --> 01:42:01,054
After circling the Ka'aba seven times

1456
01:42:01,255 --> 01:42:05,626
Muhammad destroyed each of the three
hundred sixty idols that surrounded it.

1457
01:42:06,160 --> 01:42:10,597
He then turned to the vanquished Meccans
who had sought refuge inside the shrine.

1458
01:42:10,998 --> 01:42:15,769
His own brethren, who had oppressed and
attacked the Muslims for so many years.

1459
01:42:17,204 --> 01:42:22,776
He says, if you were in my position right now,
what do you think you would do

1460
01:42:24,278 --> 01:42:28,649
and the Meccans are afraid
they're about to die.

1461
01:42:29,750 --> 01:42:33,320
And then he says, you are all pardoned.

1462
01:42:34,188 --> 01:42:35,923
He grants them all amnesty.

1463
01:42:36,890 --> 01:42:41,528
And this was unheard of in this culture,
unheard of in this society.

1464
01:42:41,895 --> 01:42:44,598
And very unexpected among the Meccans.

1465
01:42:51,839 --> 01:42:55,676
The religion that had begun
in ridicule and persecution

1466
01:42:55,943 --> 01:42:59,279
was now thriving throughout
the Arabian peninsula.

1467
01:43:00,781 --> 01:43:06,453
But shortly after returning to Medina,
Muhammad received a premonition of his death.

1468
01:43:08,889 --> 01:43:12,960
He told his daughter Fatima that
every year during Ramadan

1469
01:43:13,160 --> 01:43:17,831
the angel Gabriel recited the Quran
to him and asked him to repeat it.

1470
01:43:18,298 --> 01:43:22,803
This year Gabriel had asked Muhammad
to recite the Quran twice.

1471
01:43:23,871 --> 01:43:28,909
I cannot but think, Muhammad said,
that my time has come.

1472
01:43:32,379 --> 01:43:34,515
In February 632

1473
01:43:34,882 --> 01:43:39,820
Muhammad made what would be his final
pilgrimage to the city of his birth.

1474
01:43:40,621 --> 01:43:45,058
On his first pilgrimage, he had led
a few hundred Muslims back to Mecca.

1475
01:43:45,592 --> 01:43:50,998
This time, tens of thousands of believers
followed in his footsteps.

1476
01:43:53,767 --> 01:43:55,235
He arrives in Mecca

1477
01:43:56,470 --> 01:44:01,341
as the leader of the Muslim people now,
not as the enemy of the Meccans.

1478
01:44:01,942 --> 01:44:06,079
And they begin to perform
the rites of the pilgrimage.

1479
01:44:06,814 --> 01:44:08,148
And during this period

1480
01:44:08,582 --> 01:44:14,354
Muhammad defines the rites of pilgrimage as
they're performed today.

1481
01:44:17,090 --> 01:44:21,128
Michael Wolfe has written
extensively about the Hajj

1482
01:44:21,328 --> 01:44:26,934
the traditional pilgrimage which every Muslim
is expected to perform at least once.

1483
01:44:27,701 --> 01:44:32,206
Two to three million Muslims from
around the world travel to Mecca

1484
01:44:32,206 --> 01:44:37,611
every year for this five day ritual,
which takes them in the footsteps of Abraham

1485
01:44:38,011 --> 01:44:44,218
the ancient patriarch from whom Muslims,
Jews, and Christians all trace their lineage.

1486
01:44:45,419 --> 01:44:51,225
In 1990 Michael Wolfe, a convert to Islam,
took part in his first Hajj.

1487
01:44:56,630 --> 01:45:00,000
The Hajj was one of the most
attractive elements

1488
01:45:00,734 --> 01:45:08,575
in Islam to me as a non-Muslim and
then as a Muslim.

1489
01:45:09,376 --> 01:45:13,881
When I finally became a Muslim
after 20 or more years of thinking it over

1490
01:45:14,815 --> 01:45:17,518
the first thing I wanted to do was
make the Hajj.

1491
01:45:21,788 --> 01:45:26,193
When I circled the Ka'aba for the first time,
I was in a state of wonder.

1492
01:45:26,727 --> 01:45:31,498
You're there with ten of thousands of people,
all doing the same thing at once.

1493
01:45:34,101 --> 01:45:37,204
You're literally putting
God at the center of your life.

1494
01:45:37,738 --> 01:45:39,840
For that period of time.

1495
01:45:52,619 --> 01:45:55,956
At the culmination of the Hajj,
on the Plain of Arafat

1496
01:45:56,089 --> 01:46:01,495
on a small hill called the Mount of Mercy,
Muhammad gave his final sermon.

1497
01:46:02,963 --> 01:46:10,003
Here is a man who began his mission
as this individual in Mecca, persecuted, with

1498
01:46:10,003 --> 01:46:15,509
with almost no followers, and his life
is completed with a valley filled

1499
01:46:15,509 --> 01:46:20,414
with tens of thousands of people, uh,
that have accepted his message.

1500
01:46:20,814 --> 01:46:24,618
And, and there he is,
preaching to them his final sermon.

1501
01:46:24,751 --> 01:46:29,723
And in it in a sense is a summation
of this universal teaching.

1502
01:46:30,224 --> 01:46:35,762
He tells them to be good to each other,
and not to violate each other's rights.

1503
01:46:36,163 --> 01:46:41,268
For men and women to treat each other
humanely, for brothers and sisters to treat

1504
01:46:41,268 --> 01:46:45,172
each other well, and for Muslims to treat
each other as brothers and sisters.

1505
01:46:46,039 --> 01:46:52,312
And perhaps most importantly,
he calls an end to revenge, to blood killing

1506
01:46:52,813 --> 01:46:54,114
to the vendetta

1507
01:46:54,882 --> 01:47:00,254
which has bled this culture terribly
since he was born.

1508
01:47:00,954 --> 01:47:07,528
At the end of Muhammad's sermon,
he does not list his achievements.

1509
01:47:07,961 --> 01:47:10,998
This man has unified people.

1510
01:47:11,532 --> 01:47:14,501
He has taught them monotheism.

1511
01:47:15,502 --> 01:47:18,772
He has brought them to peace.

1512
01:47:18,906 --> 01:47:22,843
And yet he doesn't mark these
as his accomplishments.

1513
01:47:23,243 --> 01:47:26,113
Quite the opposite,
he asks his community

1514
01:47:26,446 --> 01:47:30,684
"Have I fulfilled my mission"

1515
01:47:31,318 --> 01:47:34,154
"To my God, and to you?"

1516
01:47:34,788 --> 01:47:41,328
You can hear in his words the desire
for a completed mission.

1517
01:47:42,229 --> 01:47:47,935
This is a man of faith
who is unsure of his affects.

1518
01:47:48,335 --> 01:47:54,474
It's a very human moment in which
he needs to know, and he asks

1519
01:47:55,609 --> 01:47:59,613
and the people affirm that yes,
three times they say, yes

1520
01:48:00,247 --> 01:48:01,849
you have fulfilled your mission.

1521
01:48:05,018 --> 01:48:10,457
This, was not a leader who was looking
for his legacy in time.

1522
01:48:10,757 --> 01:48:15,562
It wasn't for any purpose other than
to make sure that

1523
01:48:15,629 --> 01:48:19,500
when he was going to face his maker,
he was going to be accountable.

1524
01:48:20,100 --> 01:48:24,872
And he was, he would be in a position
of saying Allah, I did the best I could.

1525
01:48:24,872 --> 01:48:27,841
And, and I hope I was
successful in doing it.

1526
01:48:28,775 --> 01:48:32,179
Uh, and that's all what
we can do as human beings.

1527
01:48:37,518 --> 01:48:42,422
I think that if I were to say that
I hope to exemplify

1528
01:48:42,523 --> 01:48:44,725
any part of Prophet Muhammad's life

1529
01:48:45,092 --> 01:48:49,129
it would be the issues around
the dignity near the end of life.

1530
01:48:51,565 --> 01:48:56,003
He's a good friend of mine and
I know he knows my voice.

1531
01:48:56,036 --> 01:48:58,038
And now I know for sure
he knows my voice.

1532
01:49:01,108 --> 01:49:07,181
I'm visiting Mr. Hamoud,
who is a patient that's terminal.

1533
01:49:12,653 --> 01:49:17,291
When he was not in the condition
he's in now, he was very delightful

1534
01:49:17,291 --> 01:49:22,062
very loving and very much wanting
to tell his story

1535
01:49:22,062 --> 01:49:24,965
so we'd sit and listen and talk
for long hours and

1536
01:49:24,965 --> 01:49:28,635
he'd give me all his history and his past,
so we're very bonded.

1537
01:49:31,638 --> 01:49:35,309
Um, he's slipped into a more terminal stage,
meaning less responsive.

1538
01:49:35,609 --> 01:49:37,511
Well he responds,
he's just unable to speak.

1539
01:49:40,747 --> 01:49:44,818
Prophet Muhammad has taught us that
near the time of death, the holy Quran

1540
01:49:44,985 --> 01:49:47,554
to hear is soothing,
very soothing to the soul.

1541
01:49:48,455 --> 01:49:52,559
And since it's a part of our lives
on a daily basis anyway

1542
01:49:52,559 --> 01:49:55,896
we derive great comfort from
the hearing of the Quran.

1543
01:49:57,564 --> 01:50:01,335
While I'm stroking a head or
I'm speaking softly

1544
01:50:01,969 --> 01:50:04,304
I say the things that
I think Muhammad would say.

1545
01:50:05,539 --> 01:50:06,373
Prophet

1546
01:50:06,607 --> 01:50:08,342
Muhammad has taught us that

1547
01:50:08,575 --> 01:50:11,011
we don't even understand,
we could never comprehend

1548
01:50:11,011 --> 01:50:15,182
the value of taking care of the ill or
providing for the dying

1549
01:50:15,516 --> 01:50:17,284
maintaining their dignity.

1550
01:50:18,652 --> 01:50:22,489
And I believe that that's my mission,
to be the helper, to be the listener

1551
01:50:23,490 --> 01:50:25,792
to be a comforter in many ways.

1552
01:50:34,468 --> 01:50:37,738
The Prophet knew that death was coming

1553
01:50:37,971 --> 01:50:41,575
he had an indication that he would not be
around for much longer.

1554
01:50:42,543 --> 01:50:46,580
MUHAMMAD had been feeling ill.
He'd had some fever.

1555
01:50:47,381 --> 01:50:52,719
It was clear that he was in real difficulty
in terms of his health.

1556
01:50:53,420 --> 01:50:58,025
And the household seemed to be convinced that
MUHAMMAD was dying.

1557
01:50:59,126 --> 01:51:01,061
And while he was on his deathbed

1558
01:51:01,662 --> 01:51:06,533
and there were many who surrounded him,
especially his close companions and his family

1559
01:51:07,134 --> 01:51:10,537
he called for silence around him.

1560
01:51:11,004 --> 01:51:16,476
And he wanted it to be a time of quiet and
of peace and of calm.

1561
01:51:17,878 --> 01:51:21,582
Embraced by the community
he had founded in Medina and

1562
01:51:21,582 --> 01:51:24,151
cared for by his wives and companions

1563
01:51:24,451 --> 01:51:29,389
Muhammad died peacefully on
June 8th, in the year 632.

1564
01:51:31,525 --> 01:51:34,962
The news of his death shocked
his followers, especially Umar

1565
01:51:35,262 --> 01:51:38,031
who believed Muhammad
would outlive them all.

1566
01:51:38,699 --> 01:51:41,201
People began to hear
the Prophet is dead.

1567
01:51:41,568 --> 01:51:47,140
Umar went to the center square and
started to say

1568
01:51:48,041 --> 01:51:52,446
there are hypocrites and liars who are
saying that the Prophet is dead.

1569
01:51:53,680 --> 01:51:59,486
In the midst of this chaos, Abu Bakr reminded
the Muslims of a verse from the Quran

1570
01:51:59,486 --> 01:52:02,890
that had first been revealed
after the battle of Uhud

1571
01:52:03,323 --> 01:52:06,393
when they feared that Muhammad
had been killed.

1572
01:52:07,828 --> 01:52:10,497
Abu Bakr,
comes into this scene of pandemonium.

1573
01:52:10,898 --> 01:52:15,836
And he immediately, uh,
stands up and says

1574
01:52:16,103 --> 01:52:20,207
whoever worshipped Muhammad, uh,
then know that Muhammad is dead.

1575
01:52:20,574 --> 01:52:25,946
But whoever worshipped God,
know that God lives on and never dies.

1576
01:52:26,180 --> 01:52:29,650
And so, suddenly these people are
brought to their senses

1577
01:52:30,050 --> 01:52:34,988
that indeed that Muhammad is, is a man.

1578
01:52:34,988 --> 01:52:36,323
And men are mortal.

1579
01:52:36,590 --> 01:52:37,958
And, and this is his legacy.

1580
01:52:38,192 --> 01:52:43,430
He, he did everything within his power
to prevent himself from being worshipped.

1581
01:52:43,430 --> 01:52:49,636
Because he recognized that that was a danger
inherent in religious tradition.

1582
01:52:49,837 --> 01:52:53,941
That the object of worship
becomes the messenger, and not

1583
01:52:54,274 --> 01:52:56,143
uh, the one sending the message.

1584
01:53:07,254 --> 01:53:11,058
Prophet Muhammad was a man,
he was flesh and blood

1585
01:53:11,291 --> 01:53:15,262
who brought one of the most eloquent
revelations to mankind.

1586
01:53:15,629 --> 01:53:17,197
He's set an example

1587
01:53:18,031 --> 01:53:22,569
to mankind through his behavior,
through his actions, a living example.

1588
01:53:23,303 --> 01:53:26,206
This is a legacy that
he has left for Muslims.

1589
01:53:26,874 --> 01:53:30,277
Muhammad's legacy is obviously
the seed that he planted.

1590
01:53:30,344 --> 01:53:34,882
It is his righteousness,
his honesty, his integrity

1591
01:53:35,349 --> 01:53:40,320
his model as uh as a political leader,
his model as an individual

1592
01:53:40,888 --> 01:53:45,492
a man who has uh made great
accomplishments in his time

1593
01:53:45,492 --> 01:53:50,931
and yet who didn't let the successes uh
overpower him

1594
01:53:51,231 --> 01:53:54,134
didn't let his ego get the best of him.

1595
01:53:54,735 --> 01:53:59,206
He remains, I think,
more than anything else a great role model.

1596
01:54:00,474 --> 01:54:03,310
MUHAMMAD is the kind of person

1597
01:54:04,011 --> 01:54:10,717
who combines political and military and
social and religious

1598
01:54:11,018 --> 01:54:15,189
and intellectual dimensions of life
in ways that are important

1599
01:54:15,189 --> 01:54:18,559
for those of us in the 21st century

1600
01:54:18,992 --> 01:54:22,462
who are struggling to put together
complete lives ourselves.

1601
01:54:24,431 --> 01:54:30,938
If I were to have met Prophet Muhammad
on the street, I feel like I would know him.

1602
01:54:31,438 --> 01:54:34,641
And as though he would know all of us.

1603
01:54:36,610 --> 01:54:40,647
The beauty of it is, we live our lives
through his examples, but he's not God.

1604
01:54:41,215 --> 01:54:42,716
Our reverence is to God.

1605
01:54:43,317 --> 01:54:45,185
And our reference is to him.

1606
01:54:46,353 --> 01:54:49,790
So how I walk, and how I speak,
and how I carry myself

1607
01:54:50,457 --> 01:54:53,360
and how I treat my husband, and
how I treat my mother and my father

1608
01:54:53,360 --> 01:54:56,029
and how I behave as a sister and a daughter

1609
01:54:56,029 --> 01:54:58,298
and a nurse and a friend and a neighbor

1610
01:54:59,500 --> 01:55:01,835
that's all prophet Muhammad in action.
