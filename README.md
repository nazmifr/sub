# Subtitles by NazmiFR

Subtitles are awesome, they're a big part of me speaking english, I learned so many words and got exposed to so many ideas while making subtitles. Sadly most of my works are not available and they are not revision controlled.

Google did something right when they proposed community powered subtitles but the implementation lacked:
- revision control
- discussion in the team of subbers
- better attribution of the work that was made
- financial support for the subbers to work more

Here are my subtitles, I encourage anyone doing subtitle work to open a repository on github as well and perharps we could build a subtitling platform that'd be open and enable us to collaborate to produce more high quality subtitles !

There is also amara but they really try to enforce people to use their tool and are egoistical in nature, I don't really know what's odd about them but I just don't feel using their platform.. That's just too clean and epurated to me. Even the name feels like a new-age yoga thing.

Also should we have a platform we'd be able to compare various versions of subtitles and create better "official" subtitles, like comparing the official sub to a fansub and seeing which is better and how to enhance both.
